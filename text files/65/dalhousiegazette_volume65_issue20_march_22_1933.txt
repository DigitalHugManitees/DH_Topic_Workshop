Munro Day Glee
Club

 

Glee Club is certainly picking
up. Following the Minstrel
Show, came the excellent performance staged for Munro Day
under the supervision of Joe
Connoly. The one—and only—
criticism of the show was that
it was a trifle long, but that is
really not to be considered, since
the show was so truly good.

The idea of a musical show
although new for Dalhousie, has
certainly been well received—
and well done. It ig surprising
how much, talent there is in the
college—need I mention names—
just look at your programs.
Perhaps the most striking part
of the show was the excellent
color effects. The Electrician
certainly knew his stuff, and so
did the costumers, for the lights
and costumes blended most effectively. Speaking of blending,
what smooth harmony in such
numbers as ‘As You. Desire
Me, =the Double Quartette,

“Darkness on the Delta’ and
“Three Little Maids,”’

Doug always said the chorus
could. either make or break a
show—and the chorus in this
show certainly made it. Not a
hitch, not a misstep, and what
cheery faces! Butif the C. O.T.
C. uniforms and the tuxedos
worn are any indication of how
girls are going to look in men’s
clothing, let’s pray for a return
to ye good ole female and effeminate clothes. The suits fitted

the chorus work was especially
good in the gypsy number, and
they were certainly patient while

N. F.C. U.S. To

Sponsor Tours

Four debating tours and one
national radio debate will be
sponsered next session by the
National Federation of Canadian University Students if present plans of its officers work out.
Two tours will take place within
Canada and two outside.

On the invitation of the National Union of Students of England and Wales, an N. F. €. U.S.
team will tour Great Britain this
fall; Canada’s team will be composed of one ‘Maritime and one!
Western Canadian student.
This will be the second N. F. C.
U.S. debating team to visit England—the first, in 1918, was
chosen from Tararito and McGill. The other tour outside
of Canada will also take place in
the fall of 1933, if suitable arrangements can be made. It
will be a tour of northwestern
United States by a Western
Canadian team,

Something in the nature of an
experiment will be tried in the
fall within Canada. The officers
of the N. F. C. U. S. are hoping | ¢
to arrange a tour of Ontario and
the three prairie provinces by a
French-speaking team from the
University ot Montreal. The
fourth debating tour of the session will take place in the spring
of 1984, when either an Australian team or one from Bates College, Maine, will tour Canada
from coast to coast.

Another experiment is likely
to be tried sometime during the
session—a national radio debate
under the auspices of the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission. If it is held, the four
debators will be chosen from the
Maritimes, Central Canada, the
Priarie Universities and British
Columbia respectively.

Freshmen Win

The Bennett Shield

The final Bennett Shield Interclass Debate was held last Thursday evening at the last meeting
of Sodales for the college year.
The Seniors, represented by Miss
aoc Walker and Mr. Flint

Cahan, upheld the affirmative
of the Resolution, That in- the
Interests of Society the Truths
of History Should Sometimes be
Suppressed, while the Freshmen,
represented by Miss. Elizabeth
Ballem and Mr. Bruce Freguson,
took the negative.

Mr. Cahan took the floor amid
enthusiastic stamping and clapping. After defining the terms
of the resolution, he upheld it
on moral erounds. He suggested that publication of the results
of the Shirreff Hall Purity Tests
would have been inimical to the
best. interests of society, and
pointed out that ancestor-worship—the worship of historical
facts—has been the greatest retarding factor in Chinese development.

Mr. Ferguson, in an eloquent
speech, accused his opponents of
advocating the suppression of
truth, which, according to certain poets and Holy Scripture,
was a bad thing to do. He
asked the question, Who is to
suppress the truth? Are all
things to be censored by a small

group? This would be most
undemocratic.
Miss Walker defended the

subject from the political standpoint, and reviled the Irish,
Americans, French and Germans
who, she said, fomented trouble
by reciting old wrongs. Suppression of the truth in order to
give statesmen a chance to make
sensible decisions before the propagandists could get to -work
would, she averred, prevent wars.

Miss Ballem accused the affirmative of upholding falsehood.
She wished to know what assurance there would be that beneficial truths would not be suppressed with the others, and
she cited instances in which the
suppression of truth had had bad
results.

Messrs. Ferguson and Cahan
concluded the debate with short
rebuttals.

The meeting was thrown open,
and several members spoke from
the floor.

The decision of the judges, Dr.
Hayes and Messrs. Bennet and
Hewitt, was given to the representatives of the Freshman Class

Malcolm Honour
Students Chosen

9 a ne

The announcement of the
names of the Malcolm Honour
Students for this year has met
with unqualified approval everywhere. The three men who have
been selected as being worthy
of the highest award at the disposal of the students of this
university are unusually able,
and during their courses have
exemplified in their several ways
the spirit of Jimmy Malcolm—
one of unselfish service to the
students and_to student organizations.

Walter Campbell MacKenzie,
more familiarly known as ‘“‘Fat’’,
graduates in Medicine this spring.
Mr. MacKenzie has been one
of the most prominent figures
on the campus for eight years
having obtained his B. A. in
1929, and will be heartly missed.
He was President of the Glee
Club in 1928-29 and has always
been keenly interested in that
organization;he has been manager of the football and hockey
teams, and Secretary-Treasurer
of the D. A. A. C.; this year, as
everyone knows, he was President of the Student Council, on
which he represented medicine.
In all these offices he has shown
himself an extremely capable
man; he has conscientiously fulfilled the many duties with which
he was burdened. Moreover, he
has taken an active interest in all
student affairs, often when his
only reward was hard work.
He is a member of Phi Rho Sigma.

  
  
  
     
 

William Charles Anderson
completes his theological course
this year. His chief. interests

have always been in athletics, as
he has been President of the
D. A, A. C., and Captain and
Manager of the Senior Baske bal Team, on which he has
been a consistently steady and
valuable player for several years.
He has also been extremely
active in Y. M. C. A. work, a
well as taking a prominent part
in the affairs of the S. C. M.
He was also a member of last
year's Intercollegiate Debating
Team. Mr. Anderson is a resident of Pine Hill, where he i
known as a man who is alwayss
ready to help out; needless to
say his selection is a popular one.

George Christie Thompson,
who is in his fourth year in Commerce, has displayed his executive ability in numerous positions. He has been President
of the Commerce Society, President and Treasurer of Class ’83,
and President of his fraternity,
Delta Sigma Pi, twice for the
past 2 years he has represente
Class ’33 on the Student Council,
and was recently elected to next
year’s council as Freshman Representative. His services te
his class were recognized when
they chose him as their Life
President. Besides being a brilliant student, Mr. Thompson is
an athlete of no mean ability.
He has been a member of the
Senior Football Team for the
past two years and plays on the
Intermediate Basketball Team
as well.

These. three men have done
a great deal for Dalhousie; they
have done it unselfishly, giving
;much time and energy to the
service of their fellow students:
the Malcolm Honour Key is a
fitting reward and in the opinion
of the whole University, a welldeserved one.

Tribute Paid Ti
The Late Dr.
G. D. Stewart

 

Extract fromthe Minutes ofa
Meeting of the Governors,
Senate and Faculties of Dal
Ti housie College at Halifax

The Governors, Senate and
faculties of Dalhousie University in joint session desire to
lace on record a tribute to the
late Dr: Stewart.

Dr. George David Stewart,
Moers va, Fh. D.; LE. B.,
was born at Malagash in the
County of Cumberland on the
28th December, 1862. After attending the District School and
Normal School he taught in the
High School in Antigonish. In
1854 he began the study of
Medicine in Bellevue Medical
College, New York. After his
graduation he began practice
in the City of New York and
became the leading surgeon in
that City.

Generous recognition was accorded to his skill and sterling
personal qualities by his professional brethren. He was President of the American College of
Surgeons and of the New York
Academy of Medicine. In recognition of the great work he
accomplished as head of the
Department of Surgery at New
York University and Bellevue
Hospital Medical College, both
as a teacher and demonstrator,
the late George F. Baker, a
patient, gave $1,000,000 to the
New York University to found
the George David Stewart Endowment for Surgery. In acknowledging the gift the chancellor of the University described
Dr. Stewart as ‘not only a great
operator and director of surgical
research but also a consummate
teacher.”’

Dr. Stewart was a B. A. of St.
Francis Xavier and a Ph. D. of
New York University. At Convocation in May, 1929 this
University conferred the degree
of Doctor of Laws and the occasion was marked by an admirable tribute to his worth by
his personal friend Dr. John
Stewart, the Dean of Medicine,
in presenting him to Convocation. The notable address in
acknowledging the degree delivered by Dr. Stewart was
widely and favourably commented upon by the Press.

On his death generous tributes
were paid to his memory by the
leading newspapers in Canada
and New York. He was a distinguished surgeon and an inspiring teacher, but above all
his life was marked by sympathy
for the poor and distressed and
a high code of honour, with a
loyalty to his profession and
friends. |

Dr. Stewart was a loyal son
of this Province and the Governors, Senate and Faculties desire
to record their appreciation of
the life and work of this distinguished son of Nova Scotia,
upon whom in his lifetime the|
University conferred her highest

honours. :

Scanning Our
Contemporaries.

 

In his capacity as Professor
of Political Economy in McGill,
Dr. Stephen Leacock gave fellow
educators his views on examinations and compulsion in education; he said “The attitude of
the student is hopelessly distorted by the written examination
system. He ‘comes from the
exams with a damaged mind.”’

On the other hand Dr. Leacock, better known for his humourous writings than for his
classroom lectures recommended
compulsory attendance in college classes. He said: ‘‘Keep
the students nailed down to
their seats. I once introduced
the practice of locking the students out, who arrived after
the hour had struck, but I had
to lock myself out for the sake
of consistency. Nowadays of
course corporal punishment is
held to be an extreme and
odious task torture and I don’t
use it even in the graduate
school; although I bet I could
hurry the students along with
eg

College Convicts.

The college man has been the

target for many startling accusations and criticism in the past,
but now comes the disquiting
information that no small number of coilegians spend considerab e time in jail.
_ The Cornel Daily Sun recently published an article by no
less an authority than the Chaplin of Sing Sing, Dr. Peterson,
who declares that during his
long term of office he has come
in contact with men representing all the important colleges of
the U.S. A., most of the smaller
ones and not a few foreign institutions. The most popular
crime among these alumni groups
is forgery. From this fact Dr.
Peterson concludes that their
college education has not benefitted them much. because it is the
easiest crime to detect.

Of course the incarcerated
degree-holders do not perform
manual labor as assigned to the
alien criminals, because their
talents can be used to better
advantage elsewhere. However
if the Chaplin had his way the
would work, because he believes
that the college convict is far
below the average prisoner.
The man who has failed to take
advantage of his training, opportunities and general background
is more to be condemned than
the fellow who has never had a
chance in life; according to Dr.
Paterson.

There seems to be no definite
reason why the college man goes
wrong. Dr. Paterson believes
that “drinking and social excesses’’ are partially accountable,
while pre-college training at
home bears some relation to the
situation.

Connie has been reminiscing
of the good old days when
Whiskey Jake entertained and
electrified the press of three
continents, to say nothing of
providing headline news for two
of Canada’s “Hotcha newspapers’, to use his own phrase;
but the women showed that
they could take it, and now it is
their turn. ‘Connie is trying to
teach the males of Dalhousie
the manners of gentlemen, not
of boors and little boys. She
thought for a long time that
their mothers might have told
them the facts, but she was

wrong. Misled by the vitriolic
burblings of dear old Whiskey
they continue to malign the

fair sex, its manners and morals.

To those of them who harshly
condemn the scanty apparel of
the co-eds, Connie would suggest that after the last Glee
Club show. they had better try
to uplift some of their own sex.

And since we seem to be
collecting examples of male vanity, how about blind dates?
Any callow youth will ask a
strange woman to go out with
him_and complain bitterly if the
fortunate maiden is not a combination of several movie queens.
But consider the other side of
the picture; the lady, dressed
in her best, is waiting hopefully
(the optimist.) for Prince Charming. But Hark! Who comes?
(Silence of two minutes, followed
by shriek of horror). Oh, gawd,
take it away..

Connie found herself smiling

secretly the other day when she

heard a gangling youth chatter
familiarly of the Hall, and of
how he had felt many of the
Hallers’ little hearts beat against
his own. But Connie. knew
better. She knew that to these
same girls he, the little boaster,
was one of the undesirables.
in other words he was purely and
simpy “one large pain.’”” Need
more be said? Heaven knows
that those Don Juans who kiss
and tell are bad enough. but
Romeos whose amorous escapades exist only in their own
imaginations should have been
drowned when they were kittens.

HAZING SCORED BY
SODALES.

. Sodales Debating Society went
on record last Thursday evening
as being opposed to the initiation
and hazing of freshmen and
freshettes. The following resolulion, moved by Ben Rogers and
seconded by Harold Egan, was
carried after a ward discussion
by an overwhelming majority,
only seven votes being recorded
against it:

WHEREAS many. universities have either abolished or are
holding in abeyance their right
to initiate newcomers to such
institulions, and

WHEREAS Dalhousie students have been held up to ridicule, and have been given much}.
adverse publicity due to the
retention of the custom of i initiation, and

WHEREAS it is generally
conceded that the policy of
initiating newcomers is not, by
nature, productive of any positive good, and

WHEREAS such a _ policy
may be definitely harmful to
some students, besides being
silly and ridiculous in the extreme ;

BE IT THEREFORE RESOLVED that Sodales disapproves of the practice of initiating newcomers to this Univer-|
sity as it is at present carried
out; that the policy of hazing
be completely eliminated; and
that Freshmen and Freshettes
be merely distinguished from
members of the upper classes
by some small, comparatively
inconspicuous and ornamental
badge.

On motion, the secretary was
directed to send a copy of the
resolution to the secretary of the
Students’ Council.

dance in the ballroom of the

was provided by Don Murray

was served at midnight. The
chaperones for the occasion were

Barrel styled in Striped Laminations
as shimmering as velvet—yet non-breakable

Now appears a fountain pen witn a twice greater ink

capacity! A twice-as-useful point! A twice greater
; beauty and distinction! A twice greater value for the
money! It is revolutionary in principle and perfectly
marvelous in performance.

Not the first pen without an ink sac— but the first of
these to contain no pump, piston or valves— nothing
to fail after a brief span ‘of service. Its name is the
Parker Vacuum Filler Pen. It is Geo. S. Parker's
masterpiece.

“Thus Parker Pens are now made two ways: with ink
sac at from $2.75 to $7, and the new Parker Vacuum
Filler (without ink sac) at $7.50.

By abolishing the ink-sac found in all conventional
pens, Parker’s marvelous Vacuum Filler increases the
ink capacity 102% without increasing the size!

Its point is reversible —a two-way writer— made of
platinum and gold. Upper side writes hair-line figures.
Lower side writes fine, medium or broad.

Parker commissioned a great creative artist to producein this pen a wholly new style, the smartest and
most distinguished ever given the world. The barrel is
built up, layer on layer —!aminated—to form alternate stripes of Silver Pearl and Jet, or Burgundy Pearl
and Jet. Its exclusiveness is protected by Parker patents.

a ' Would you like to see how ingeniously this pen fills

beauty of its laminated barrel? Would you like to
write two ways with one pen? Then stop at any nearby

‘““T Love You.” Jerry Naugler’s
ever popular performance both
on the piano and the accordion.
Both Dorothy Gray and Connie
Jost lived up to their reputation
gained in the Minstrel Show.
And say, while we're speaking
in musical terms, how about
that touching burlesque.

The Three Plays were an
important part of the program,
all acted in a most dramatic
manner, especially in ‘“The Glittering Gates’’ And did you
notice? The whole three plays
had mention of picking locks
and forcing doors. What do
they think Dalhousie will come
to with such examples?

A group of tired badminton
players from Mount Allison University bowed to Dalhousie’s
representatives in twenty-three
out of twenty-four matches played in the Dal,.Gym on Friday
night. This is the first occasion
in the history of Maritime Colleges that an _ Intercollegiate
Badminton match has been played. This was the first match in
a two game series and the return
match will be played in Sackville
on Friday, 24th March.* Each
of last Friday’s games was bitterly fought and every point well
contested. The Mount A. players had been up since three
o'clock in the morning fighting
the fire which swept their college
and in addition were tired from
the train trip down for they
arrived at seven-thirty and the
matches began at nine.

Pacifism.—Watch the notice
boards for a notice regarding
time and place of a meeting at
which Dalhousie students may
voice their opinion on this subject that has been engaging the
attention of Students in Oxford
University and more latel'y Toronto University. This matter
is of major importance in these
precarious days.

Annual Meeting of S. C. M.
—The annual meeting of the
S. C. M. will take the form of
a supper meeting at St. Andrew’s
Church Hall on Thursday evening at 6.00 o’clock. There will
be a very brief review of the
year’s activities and the election
of officers for the coming year.
A short musical program will
be presented. A good supper
will be provided by the ladies
of St. Andrew’s. Members and
friends of the movement are
invited and urged to attend.
Tickets are 35 cents.

We understand that the number. of plucks at Christmas
was unusually low. We believe that it was on account
of the fact that we sold more
coffee. We'll:be here to serve
you with them good old coffee
“bracers” and a 20c. lunch,
during the Spring Exams.

ers Defeated By

The Mount Allison debaters
met their first defeat in several
years when a team from King’s
argued them down on Friday,
March 17 in the College -Residence. The subject was ‘“‘Resolved that this house approves
of an economic order based on
Socialistic principles,’’ Kings upholding the affirmative. Dr. A.
H. _Moore presided and the
judges were: Dr. D.C. Harvey,
Dean S. E. Smith, J. W. a
frey.

The Mt. A. speakers, E. P.|
Weeks (leader), J. E.. Munsen
and. MacQueen, gave their argument in favour of capitalism, |
stating facts to show its efficien- |
cy and outlining its advantages |
as a means of progress as against
the retarding. impracticable theories of socialism. Messrs. C.
Carter. R. Sweatnam and E. B.
Cochran, the King’s team, denounced the evils of capitalism
as it exists, and pointed out the
numerous systematic laws of
the socialists and the opportunities such laws present for a
wider sharing of responsibilities.

The speaking was good, especially in the rebuttal of E. B.
Cochran, the King’s leader. The
debate was well attended and
the decision well received.
