Peeping Toms at
Hall

The fluttering hearts of Shirrefi Hall inmates have been disturbed several successive nights
last week, by the appearance of

two inquisitive gentlemen with
| flashlights at the windows.
| police were called, but failed to
‘trap the offenders. 
The

The climax came late Tuesday

night, when two girls were awakened at 3 o’clock by vague
mutterings
“Heigh Blondie”’

interspersed with
and grating
attempts to pry open the window. At first they sleepily ignored these sounds, but as the
cries bécame more imperative
they went to the window to
discover the identity of the intruders. Soon realizing that
these must be the offenders of
the previous nights, one engaged
them in conversation while the
other notified the police. After
a half hour of enlightening conversation, these two gentlemen
heard a car draw up behind them
only to find the police at hand.
With a few threats to their
betrayers, they made a dash
the police following. Shouts
and a shot were heard. Then
all was quiet and with many
reassurances the police departed.

No+sooner had the patrol

| wagon disappeared than one of

the culprits returned to inquire
if his companion had been seized.
Satisfaction upon this point did
not hasten his departure, although he was aware that the
police would be resummoned.
The police were again notified.
After an interval, in whith even
the visitor grew impatient, lights
were seen flashing around the
corner of the buiJding. With
“Psst, who’s around that corner”
the trespasser made a dash which
well testified his boa'sted skill
at the 100 metre. He was not
- sight when the police appeared. Although the police spent
some time inspecting the scene
of action, only a bloody handkerchief and finger prints were
found as clues.

Commands Con
tingent in WeekEnd Camp.

Despite numerous prognostications to the contrary, the
first annual camp of the Officers
Training Corps was an overwhelming success. Olver eightyfive officers and men attended,
and took part in the various
activities of the camp. Our
chief interest was musketry, and
in the annual shoot Lieut.
Carter of B Coy carried off
the honours with a score of
eighty out of a possible ninetyfive.

The evening bridge contests
were also notable events. In
this field Col. Read and Lieut.
Higgins carried off the honours,
both as regards actual play, and
in the field of story-telling
while they were acting as dummies.

Messrs. Higgins and Begg
were the champions of the steak
chewing contest, with A. R.
QO. M. S. Tanton as a close
second. Mr. Forster (our own
Julius) had an unfair advantage
in this competition. since he
used a razor blade to cut his
meat into microscopic sections.

The camp was marred, (?) by
several complaints about the
hardness of the floor, the thinness of the blankets, the noisemaking of Clennett and McFarlane, and the loss of a Lottle of
medicinal stout. These defects
were, however, partly remedied
on the second night, chiefly by
R. S. M. Regan’s thunderous
voice. But the owner has authorized the Gageite to say that any
information regarding that stout
will be amply rewarded.

The advance party made good
use of the ranges on Friday
afternoon and shot off their
classification at 200, 400 yards.
Saturday and Sunday the remainder of the contingent, under the command of Lieut. J. F.
Cahan, and Lieut. Clarke, of
the R. C. ‘R.. finished their
qualifying rounds. A machine
gun demonstration was given

Sunday, and six of the uninit-| week.

1ated were daring enough to
squat behind the gun and weave
a fancy pattern on the target.

Arrangements for the camp
were made by Col. Read, and
high tribute should be paid to
him for the very successful
way in which all details were
carried out.

As Sodales Holds

Empire Discussion

——-—
Last Wednesday night Sodales Debating Society sponsored one of the most interesting
debates held at the University
during the last few years. President Carleton Stanley was in
the Chair and in his opening
remarks he extended to the
visiting debaters a hearty welcome on behalf of the University. He stressed the importance of the Imperial Conference
at Ottawa, but stated that
there was another form of interempire co-operation which was
very important, namely cooperation between the Universities of the British Empire.
President Stanley made mention of the different nationalities to be found represented on
the professorial staff of Canadian Universities and stated
that in his opinion this element
was very important, being the
only safe-fuard against provincialism,

The Chairman then introduced the speakers for the
evening. Mr. Ivor B. Jones,
of the University College of
Wales opened the Debate as
the leader of the Affirmative.
In his opening remarks he
thanked the College for the
hospitality extended to himself
and his colleague, Mr. MacNeil. After introducing the
subject before the house,
Resolved, ‘‘That this house
approves ‘of the efforts to make
the British Empire an active
economic unit,’ he went.on to
discuss the economic changes
taking place in the world today
and pointed out very forcibly
that there must be reorganization or chaos would be the
ultimate result of this trend.
He traced the history of tariffs
and showed that they were
introduced as an expedient, but
now their usefulness was passed.
The spirit of economic nationalism which followed in their
wake disrupted the whole system of international exchange
and no progress towards a
solution of the problem confronting the world to-day would
be obtained until an international point of view replaced
the pievailing narrow nationalistic outlook.

Community Concert Committee

Holds Annual

Drive.

Stviden ta: are che utute leaders in all walks of life. The
first and most important duty
of any musical society that
wishes to have University students as members, is to teach
these members orchestral and
choral works of great composers,
and properly present these works
for the musical education of the
student body and the public at
large. A musical society which
is not capable of doing this has
no raison d'etre.

The local society—which
sponsors the Community Concert Association—has_ signally
failed to carry out its mission
and has fallen back on the
employing of outside artists to
keep it alive, and, by its sad
performances year after year,
has made any student who attended its concerts feel that the
great oratorios and other splendid works are boredom rampant.
Consequently, the effort of the
local society is reduced to a
minimum and an American organization is employed to keep
the same society in existance
by bringing in outside artists,
at what is, for we students, a
very stiff price.

FRESHIE-SOPH DANCE ---- GYMNASIUM
TUESDAY, OCTOBER 23th.

8.30 p. m. to 12.30 a.m.

JOE MILLS’ ORCHESTRA

Throng Gym.

At Annual Council Dance.

 

Event Highly Successful Despite
Unfavorable

Conditions.

 

Last Monday evening the Students’ Council were hosts to
students of the University at the
annual dance. This was the
first dance to be held in the gym
under the recent council edict,
and considering the difficulties
and the unsuitable surroundings,
the dance was a real success.

Joe Mills had a real lively
seven piece band which more
than compensated for a somewhat uneven floor. Two hundred and fifty couples danced
until 12.30, with an intermis
sion for light refreshments. The
Freshmen made capable waiters,
and although there was a shortage near the end, we all managed
to grab a plate of ice cream and
a cookie. Of course the usual
crowd of crashers were present
and an apparently unending stag
line gave many a tender freshettes heart a flutter as well as
causing righteous indignation in
the minds of those who brought
their own fair companions.

Early in the evening, Presi- |
dent Walter C. suet B,

 

Sec., welcomed the student) body
back to another year’s work—
with its trials and tribulations.
More . charming chaperones
would indeed be hard to find,
and many were the comments
on the gracious manner with
which Pisaident and Mrs. Stanley, and Dr. and Mrs. Bell
welcomed the guests. Freddie
Wigmore, as chairman of the
dance committee, deserves much
credit for the success of the
evening.

Today’s Greatest
Problem -- How
Students Can
Help.

In its last issue, the Gazette
carried an editorial about this
city’s “Million Dollar Industry’’—Dalhousie. Financially,
this university is undoubtedly
of great benefit to every person
in Halifax, but, socially we
have done little or nothing
The social problems that are
facing this city, this province,
the whole civilized world, are
so much greater, so much more
pressing than anything that
has gone before, that few, if
any, of us have fully realized
their significance, even yet.

The students of Dalhousie as
citizens, temporary citizens if
you will, of this community must
realize the terrible seriousness
of this situation, and must join

 

together to help our less fortunate neighbours. The students of all the other major

colleges in Canada have already
done much in many ways. At
McGill, the students have a
large and efficient organization

“NOTHING.” |

t

Another year has rolled past; and yet there is still present
- and we fear it will always be with us, that almost universal,
characteristic, three-fold laziness of the world at large. We
refer to that great, ignoble art of doing, saying and thinking—
“nothing.”

_  . Twentieth century civilization has, unfortunately, tended
sta. make modern. mankind lazy, indolent and decadent. All
~ those labours which heretofore had required hard work—both
mental and physical—now are done almost mechanically. How
—-_——s weiil the majority of us can do ‘“‘nothing’’ and what a total passiay. vity and disinclination to work has penetrated the very backbone
of humanity.
_~—~——s- The individual is too prone to waste precious moments in
useless conversation. Surely silent communion is much more
to be desired than the utterance of stereotyped words and
phrases in the conventional way. Let us cease this habit of idle

er and when we speak let us say something worth while.

  

ht @

how many precious moments are wasted
by day our energies are dissipated, our
ened when we ‘busy ourselves—doiag

a an”

—the average student who drifts along, just doing enough work
to pass his examinations and then finally graduating—still an
average student. Avoid this at all costs; let us do something and
do it well. Take an interest in at least one student organization;

‘put your heart and soul into its work and you will be a better
individual.

Don’t be sloppy in your thoughts. Think alertly, intelligently, always having a goal to aim for. Don’t fall by the wayside with those who think carelessly, erratically and ina disorderly
manner. Be constructive; be thorough.

f : ee. THE ART OF PUBLIC SPEAKING.

~

ere Sodales Debating Society has entered upon a new scheme
Bs for the promotion of imterest in public speaking among the
students of Dalhousie University. Under the auspices of the
Society a series of addresses will be delivered by students, and
in this way it is hoped that interest will be aroused in the art of
public speaking among members of the University. It is felt
that there is a great need for the raising of the standard of debating at Dalhousie, and this can only be obtained if sufficient interest is created among the students to support this movement,
and give it their full co-operation.

One of the objects of this movement is to give an opportunity
to the Students for training that will assist them should they
be contemplating a career in public life. It is often pointed out
ie that Canadian University men during their scholastic career,
| —s«Clack the interest in debating and public affairs that is shown by
university men in Great Britain. This was pointed out most
forcibly by a Rhodes Scholar in a conversation with J. B. McLean. When asked what difference he had found between the
ea: English and Canadian Universities he stated that the aims and
_ ideals of English students were centered on a different goal. In
Canada the main consideration was to obtain the necessary
training to enter a business or a professional career. At Oxford
the heroes were the men who by forensic agility won in debate.

ie. There is a great need in Canada today for leaders, and the
ability to express one’s views clearly and logically from a_platform is of prime necessity in a public career.

*

ae

It is therefore with this thought in mind that we feel that

interest in public speaking should be fostered at the University.
ar Sodales has done much in the past to further this end but we
feel that they have not received the co-operation necessary to
By make their efforts a success.

OUR ADVERTISERS.

F

____ Last week in this column, we pointed out to the business men
of Halifax the monetary value of the University student body.

  

Now we ask the undergraduates to consider the following thoughts.

eae ‘ |
a ____ Just as we buy British made goods, favour Maritime products
and patronize local merchants, so should we give our buying
_ support to the merchants who make possible this paper. Their
+i aperercey, and co-operation enables Dalhousie to publish the
eee} sazette,” and in return it is up to us to make it worth their
ae, hile to advertise. We must remember that today no adver____ tising is placed that does not pay for itself. A store that adver__ tises in the “Gazette” is interested in Dalhousie and us. Buy
om the merchant who solicits your purchases —co-operate.

Commission before the world,

cal drama. While the woild as
a whole seems to be maintaining
its hostile view towards Japanese fpreign policy, individual
publicists of high calibre keep
pointing out again and again
that the responsibility for the
Sino-Japanese dispute lies largely on China. In all fairness to
these wiilers, it must be said
that they do not agree with
Japan; but undoubtedly one has
to agree, with them, that the
Chinese themselves, by their
constani domes .ic embroikments,
offered the militarists of Japan
an opportunity which they were
not slow to seize. The Manchurian question by no means
stands alone. “Any plan of the
League’s which is to have any
constructive influence must have
China within its scope. At the
Liberal Summer School this sentiment was neaily expressed by
ene of the lecturers who said
that to treat Manchuria apart
is like solving a problem in
astronomy withoul thinking of
the influence of the sun.’’

2. Slavery in the world today.

It will probably come as a
sheck to many people to know
that only last year the estimate
of the numbei of persons held as
property in different parts of
the world was given as 5,000,000
persons. Just 99 years ago slavery was legally abolished within
the British Empire. Al that
time 700,000 slaves were freed.

The crusades of England against
slavery was regarded by Lecky |,

as among the three, ot four
yerfectly virtuous acts recorded
in the history of nations.’’ The
problem of abolishing slavery
is one of the most difficult yet
one of the most imperious facing
the woild today. Ina report of
1926, fifteen geographical areas
are mentioned in which slavery
is to be found. Of these China,
Arabia, Liberia and Abyssinia
are the chief. Raiding, immorality ja its grossest forms, cruelty
are the usual accompariments
of the slave trade The Treaty
of Versailles was the starting
point of the international effort
to abolish slavery; 465,389 slaves
have been emancipated during
the last ten years, through the
pressure of public opinion which
if ii can be maintained and extended, will ultimately be the
means whereby salvery will be
abolished throughout the world.

3. Opportunistic
mises,
Ever since the “slaughter campaign’’ of two. years ago when
the peasants destroyed over a
third of the nation’s supply of
live stock to prevent its forcible
seizure by the Communist authorities, Russia has been suffering
from a severe food shortage.
The Five Year Plan, based upon
a policy of strict control of the
entire marketing structure of

Compro-~
ot
the country, has been forced to
give way to a large extent in
this field. One concession has
led to another until the cumulative effect of the series of
opportunistic compromises has
been little short of revolutionary
However, it does not seem as
though the food crisis or the
retarding of her industrial development has led to any failure
in the political sense, despite
Trotsky’s remarks about ‘the
twilight of the omnipotence of
the Stalin bureaucracy.’’

DALHOUSIE GAZETTE

 

The Birth of the Budding

Barristers.

Dalhousie Students Law Societv has decided not to hold a
dance this year. This comes
as bad news to many, but cheer
up. Lawyers are never defeated. A group known as the
Budding Barristers Association
has been formed by those interested in the study of Law.
This is an organization outside
the University altogether and
hence not under the jurisdiction of the authorities. The
B. B. A. will held a dance this
year that will have all the
brillianey and the gaiety of the
now dead Law Dance.

Hazing Again.

It .is felt by many of the
students that the newspaper
attack on hazing as carried out
at Dalhousie was not only
foolish and in bad taste but
entirely unwarranted. Nevertheless it is very hard to think
of some of the things that
went on at the now famous
Frolic. without feeling just a
little disgusted with a certain
portion of the student body.
The newspaper attack itself
was not made to appear as a
piece of constructive criticism
but rather display of
wrathful abuse. At least this
is how tt seemed to many of
ius who suffered the indignity
of seeing the name of our own
University dragged in the mud.
Surely there must be some other
way of correcting an evil rather
than writing to the papers.
Surely the paper of the University concerned might have
been favoured with a _ letter
pointing out the evil rather
than immediately writing to the
daily newspapers, who are continually looking for such copyrot.

Childishness.
Many complaints have been
registered in regard to the cleanliness of the washrooms in the
Arts. Building and also in the
Library Building. To a great
extent this is due to the carelessness of some students and
the ignorance of others. It was
once said that, “Education has a
tremendous influence on conscience.’ The question is, are
some of these hooligans ignoring
their conscience or are they
lacking in education?

Dalhousie Band.

Efforts are being made to
organize a Dalhousie Band to
play at football games and
other gatherings. This plan
will undoubtedly be a success
if all those interested will put
their whole heart into it, and

with student interest so keen
on football this term one can
very well prophesy that this

will be a ‘big year in football’
at Dalhousie.

 

Changes In The

Ce It
r acuity.
Following conservatively. in
the footsteps of the student
body, the faculty has made

several changes in its personnel.
While we regret the absence of
those once familiar figures, Professors Jock Kent, Martin and
Yeo, we welcome their successors to our midst.

Dr. H. G. Grant, an old Dalhousian, our new Dean of
Medicine. He has studied extensively both tin England and
in the United States, where he
distinguished himself. specializing in preventive medicine.

Professor G. Vilbert Douglas
has taken over the classes in
Geology. Students will be in
iS

terested to know that he accompanied the Shakleton. Ex
pedition to the Antarctic
official geologist.

Professor Lionel Pearson is
lecturing in classics, while Miss
Edith Mason, also a former
Dalhousian, has joined the staff
of King’s, and is lecturing in
the French Department.

The Gazette extends to these
new members of the faculty a
most hearty welcome, and wish

Lack of Pedidence:

Not long ago it seems, there
was a cons:derable looting of the
endowment and trust funds of
the University of Manitoba. In
a letter published in a_ local
paper, the writer of which signs
himself. ‘‘Dalhousie Graduate,”
the Officials of Dalbousie are
inferentially accused of similar
tactics. He asks—‘‘what of
Dalhousie University, is all well
with the custody of the finances
of that institution?’ He raves
on in a disjointed manner concerning investigations,” which,
he states, “might be shutting
the stable door after the horse
hasescaped. If this individual
who calls himself a ‘Dalhousie
Graduate’’ has left his Alma
Mater with this impression in
his cranium he is certainly unworthy of his title. He continues his letter with rash bellowing questions—‘‘we would like
to know and are entitled to
know just what care is being
taken of the endowment funds
of Dalhousie?’ ‘‘How are they
invested?’ “Is any one. individual handling and investing
certain sums?” ‘“‘Are annual
and semi-annual audits made?’’
It may appease the “‘graduate s”’
avidity for slander uf he pause’
to realize, that every well run
organization or business publishes an auditors report for the
benefit of the ‘nterested public.
Such is the case with Dalhousie.
A financial statement and a
budget report appear at the
conclusion of each term. Oh
well, why go on giving well
known facts, especially for one
who does not want to believe
them anyway. However we are
ail entitled to our own opinions
no matter how falsely based
they may be.

Hall Notes.

—

Everyone will be glad to know
that Helen Mackie has completely recovered from her accident last Spring. At the present time she is staying in the
city with her sister, Mrs. Graham Allan and has been a
frequent visitor at the Hall.

Shirreff Hall is not content
with warding off undesirable
aliens by calling the Halifax
police force, but they are able
to defend themselves. The survivors of the freshman initiation
were showered with cold water
but showed their spirit by leaving two cannons pointing at the
front door. Marg. Sadler, who
is staying at Helen Biden’s, in
town, remarked _ characteristically, “I hear you have a
couple of “big shots’ up at the
Hall.’

The place was quite deserted
last week-end, when several girls
went home for the holiday.
Some of the poor souls remaining here went up to Kentville
for Thanksgiving dinner and
their display of the well known
Shirreff Hall appetite scandalized the entire staff of the Cornwallis Inn. Farmers in the Valley noticed a decrease in the
apple crop when they awoke
Tuesday morning.

Miss Gertrude Rutherford has
been a guest of Miss MacKeen
for the past few days.

value of History in education.

When the victor in battle,
instead of mercilessly slaughtering his prisoners, first spared
their lives and used them as his

it was a great advance and for

ounce of their mental and physical energy to the task of reorganization and reconstruction
of the very foundations of
civilization. This is an individual responsibility, and
every man and woman in the
universities of the world today
must realize it if they are to
justify their existence.

The University is no longer
merely the training ground.
It has and must become more

it must vibrate in haimony or

U. K. C. Notes

The evening of Thursday
Oct. 183th., saw the freshman
and sophomore classes of Kings
put on a dance for the College.
Joe Mills and his boys kept
the dance pepped up by giving
the dancers lots of real good
music. A number of Professors
turned out and lent to the gathering the desired air of a formal
function rather than of a ‘party

Although some originality was
lacking, and less energy was
expended than is usual on these
functions, the dance was @ success.

Encouraged bi their victory
over the Services on Saturday
Oct. 8, the Kings rugby team is
working strenuously to get into
shape. On Thanksgiving day
they had a practice. and then
hurried back to a good chicken
dinner. This year there is a
special table for the rugby men,
and this boon is certainly mak
ing these strong men stronger.
With this advantage and the
many early morning practices,
the King’s team this year will
certainly make its presence felt
in the rugby leagues.

Due to a very unfortunate accident to one of the Windsor
rugby players, the game which
the King’s team had planned
with them was postponed. The
trip was to have been on Wednesday, Oct. 12th, and the game
was to be merely an exhibition
match, to help the Kingsmen
get into playing-form.

The editor of the Kings’ College Record, Mr. R. Duchemin,
announced his staff for the year,
and the names he submitted
were approved of by the students
at the last student body meeting. An issue of the College
magazine is expected to be out
about November Ist.

 

Badminton in the Kings’ gym
is again becoming a fa'vourite
pastime. The racquets are supplied by the K.C.A.A.A. and
miany of the students are taking
the opportunity to get the exercise thus conveniently afforded.
If the Co-eds decide not to have
a basketball team this year,
most of their activities will
probably be on the badminton
court and they should be able to
turn out some good players.

The Kings’ College Library is
now open and provides a bright
and comfortable place in which
the studious members of the
College may pursue their academic hopes unmolested.

Dalhousie Tigers obtained revenge for their defeat at the
hands of Mount A. at Sackville
last week when they defeated
this aggregation at Studley on
Friday last by a score of five to
nothing. Urged on by a good
turnout of students, the Varsity
team were always on the aggressive and only through hard
luck failed to carry the ball
across the line in the early part
of the game. George Thompson
turned in a fine performance on
the three-quarter line, being
ably supported by Connor, Davidson, McRae, and all the other
members of the team who worked hard for a win from the opening whistle. Mount <A. although the lighter team, worked
well together. Their backfield
Was exceptionally fast and gave
the Dalhousie rooters many anxious moments. The Mount A.
