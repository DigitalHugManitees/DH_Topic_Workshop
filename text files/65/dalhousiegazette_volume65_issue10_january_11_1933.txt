Daniel Philip Wallace is this
year’s Nova Scotia Rhodes Scholar. This outstanding achievement provides a fitting climax
to his outstanding career at
Dalhousie. After a very success
ful record at St. Mary’s Collegate he came to. Dalhousie in
1929 and graduated with distinction in English, Mathematics
and French in 1931. He is at
present. pursuing his studies at
the University and will receive
his Master’s degree in English
this year.

Next fall he will go to England
to continue his studies in French
and English at Oxford.

Besides a very high scholastic
record. Dan has attained great
honors in. the field of - sport.
One of Canada’s premier scullers, he represented Nova Scotia
at the Olympic trials and took
second place. He was Maritime
single sculls champion in both
intermediate and ‘senior classes
in 1930 and won the senior
championship again in 1931 and
1932. He was also winner for
three. successive years of the
Harbour . Championship — for
single oarsmen. In 1981 ‘he
journeyed to St. John, N. B.
and returned with the Ross Cup.

His athletic prowess has not

_to be Delivered
in Dal Gymnasium

With the announcement of
the Exchange Scholarships for
1933-34, a limited number of
students at Dalhousie University have the opportunity of
obtaining a year’s scholarship
at some other -Canadian University. These scholarships, which
are sponsored by the National
Federation of Canadian Univetsity Students, enable students
to study at an “exchange’’ university for one year without
paying tuition fees or Students
Union Fees... The N.F.C.U‘S.
representative on this campus
is Mr. W. H. Jost and prospective applicants can obtain full
details from him.

Under the “Exchange of Undergraduates Flan’’ the universities are divided into four groups
—the University of British Columbia, the universities of the
Prairie Provinces, the universities of Ontario and Quebec,
and the universities of the Maritimes. Scholarships may be awarded only where a student of
one university wishes to obtain
a scholarship at a university in
a different ‘division.’ This is
subject to one exception—Ontario students may apply for
scholarships to French-Canadian
universities in Quebec for the
purpose of taking special studies
in the French language and vice
versa.

Any student, male or female,
may apply if he is, at the time
of his application, in the second
year of his course or, in the
case of five year courses, in the
second or third year. It is

Consequently a Sophomore taking the usual four-year Arts
course may be awarded a scholarship for his third year; in the
case of five-year courses the
scholarship may be awarded either for the third or fourth year.

An Exchange Scholar is expected to be a _ représentative
student of his ‘‘Shome’’ university in every way. It is not
necessary that he should have a
first-class academic standing but
he must be a competent student
who will be able to enter freely
into the life of the ‘‘exchange”’
university without fear of classroom consequences.

About fifty students have received Exchange Scholarships
during the past four years. This
year a total of seven are enjoying the privileges of the Exchange Plan—two at McGill,
two at Dalhousie, two at Alberta,
and one at Toronto. In most
eases the saving in tuition fees
more than balances the transportation costs involved. Applications must be handed in to
the N.F.C.U.S. representative
before March Ist, 1933.

Dal Tigers Begin
Hockey Practices
At Forum

The Dal Tigers had their
third workout at the Forum
yesterday. Prospects for a team
were brightened, for the boys
skated faster and played better
hockey on the whole. In their
previous exhibitions they looked
bad, and as one spectator remarked, They might develop
a few skaters by next year.”

There was one fact brought
to light which impressed this
writer. There is a feeling on
the campus that in order to
secure a. place on the team one
must join one of the  frats.”
This is absolutely untrue and
very unjust as far as hockey
goes, for every person that turned out this year was given his
chance.

Laurie Teasdale is again manager of the squad with Poiter
Oyler as coach. Both manager
and coach are working hard,
and believe that they will turn
out a team that will be a credit
to the university.

A goal tender is badly wanted.
The defence looks impressive
with Best, Kyte, Brennan and
Connors doing duty behind the
blue line. Stay behind that line
a little more boys—watch that
knee Kyte. Stanfield has been
showing up better with each
practise, and when teamed with
Bryant and Ellis the whole three
teamed up well. Oyler was
working Smith, Cooke and Cole
hard and they look all right,
although not as impressive as
the Stanfield, Bryant, Ellis line.
Bishop, Covert and Christie are
hard workers and are expected
to go places.

‘THE RHODES SCHOLARSHIP.

oo For the fourth consecutive year the Nova Scotia Rhodes

‘outstanding record which he has built up for himself during his

“COMMENT

A Brief hor Apostles.

 

Ireland.

The Anglo-Persian Oil Dispute

 

The Phillipines.

A Brief for Apostles.

Mark Pattison, in one of his
essays, said of the apologists of
the eighteenth century that they
had left the bench for the bar,
and taken a brief for the Apostles. Recent happenings would
seem to justify the application
of that statement to the British
Foreign Office, particularly with
reference to events in the Far
East. The Apostles, for their
purpose, are the Japanese. Since
the publication of the Lytton
Report, the French constructive
plan for disarmament, and Mr.
Stimson’s letter to Mr. Borah,
with their embodimeat of the
principle of the illegality of
armed conflict in an international community organised for
peace, neutrality is rendered
equally unlawful. Mr. Stimson
in his letter of August 8tn, expressly said that war is no longer
the source and subject of rights.
It is an illegal thing. Yet,
with this bugbear removed, neither Mr. Ramsay MacDonald or
Sir John Simon have said one
committal word on Mr. Stimson's declaration. The bearing
of the Foreign Secretary at
Geneva has spread distrust of
British policy throughout Europe and the United States.
The constant appeals of Lord
Cecil, of Lord Lothian and Lord
Ponsonby for some statement of
British policy indicating where
the government stands on the
question of world security and
of respect for international obligations and the upholding of
the Lytton Report, have been
left unanswered, while the peace
of the world is literally at stake.

‘Can it be, as Mr. Wickham

Steed asks, that the National
Government fears collective re‘sponsibility more than it fears
war?

Ireland.

On the basis of recent developments, many observers are predicting a victory for Mr. DeValera in the coming Irish elections. More specifically, the developments referred to are the
refusal of the Labor supporters
to withdraw their alliance and
the threatened split in the Cosgrave ranks due to one of its
prominentmembers remarks concerning a union with Ulster and
England’s pressure on the Irish.
But what se@ms to be generally
overlooked is that characteristic
so notable in political parties of
having one of its members utter
well-calculated rash statements.
This is one of those political
manipulations so characteristic
of Palmerston and Joseph Chamberlin. There is réason to believe that the threatened split
in Cosgrave’s party is no more
than such a flourish and if one
were compelled to predict the
results of the election, a very
precarious undertaking in any
event, Cosgrave would be our
pick as the winner.

Anglo-Persian Oil Dispute.

Discussion of the Anglo-Persian oil dispute has been adjourned by the League of Nations Council, and will come
up for discussion January 23rd,
by which time the Persian Government will have prepared its
case. The outcome of the dispute cannot, of course, be predicted with any certainty, but
the possibility of a peaceful
settlement, though not necessarily a rapid one, does not
appear to be too remote, despiie
the fact that the Shah of Persia
is a} sworn believer in force. In
many quarters prime responsibility for the Persian attitude
is found in the agreement enterin with Iraq in 1931 by the
Anglo-Iraq Oil Co. In that agreement the Iraq government
were guaranteed a minimum re

Technical Courses

Give Way To
Classes In College

In good times, when big business went about seeking technicians in such numbers that the
colleges and universities were
unable to meet the overwhelming demand, tech. courses became the rage, in the institutions
of higher learning. This condition was a serious one for such
classes as English and Philosophy and the other Arts. So the
respective Professors objected,
but were laughed down. They
were as helpless as a Geology
student with an exam paper in
front of him. But now things
will be different for these Professors, if Dr. Walters, president
of the University of Cincinnati
is correct in his prophecy. He
believes that because of the
economic condition colleges will
start teaching students how to
occupy their leisure time, of
which they will have plenty in
the next few years. President
Walters admits that the first
function of an University is to
prepare students for their work
of life. A second function is the
training for the leisure of life
and how that idleness can be
used to best advantage.
Certainly the greatest problem
facing our economic system today, and in the next quarter of a
century, is that of enforced
leisure and unemployment. He
suggests for the problem of enforced idleness a definite program ofintellectualwork. The
cultivation of good reading and
writing are important factors and
one authentic sign of a nation’s
becoming intellectual is a luxuriant crop of amateur writers.”

venue, irrespective of the company’s profit. If this is not the
cause of Persia’s attitude, it at
least has been effective in making that attitude more pregnacious and stiff, than it would
otherwise have been. It is significant that Persia has no nonaggression pact with Iraq. In
any event such a guarantee,
making for an easier balanced
Budget, goes far in conciliating
the country which grants the
concession. It is to be hoped
that something of this sort, a
via media between the Shah’s
extravagant. demands and the
company’s ironclad adhesion to
a written contract, can be successfully negotiated by the Lea
igue Council with the assistance

of its legal advisor, the Permanent Court.

The Phillipines.

The United States Congress
has voted the independence ot
the Phillipines at last, but by
the strings attached to it, they
have by their selfish action
taken all the benefit out of the
bill. Raymond Leslie Buell who
is a most competent observer
has written an article about it
under the significant title “* Hypocrisy and the Phillipines.’ The
bill has the effect of sacrificing
the Islands to American Busi
ness interests and of further
straining American relations

with Japan. Today the United
States controls three-quarters of
the foreign trade of the Island,
The bill, which should provide
opportunity of readjustment to
new conditions, does nothing of
the sort. American exporters
are to continue to enjoy thei:
present manopoly; only 615,000
tons of sugar are allowed to be
exported from the Islands, which
in the year 1932 produced
1,000,000 tons. As a result the
Philippines will be thrown into
economic chaos. These injustices, which are only a_ few
among mamy, are passed in the
name of liberty. It séems likely
that unless amendments are carried out, the United States will
learn the truth of George Eliot's
saying that consequences are
determined not by excuses but by
actions.

Students’ Executive Council as a
pilot. Although the case is
known to many there may be a
few who are not aware of. the
facts. Details are scarce as we
must rely entirely on statements
im the Daily itself. Trouble began when an article entitled
“Beer Infuses Students with
Carefree Jollity’’ appeared on
the front page of the Daily.
The story was an account of a
trip made to a brewery by a
McGill club. The story was at
at it’s worst tactless but was
essentially truthful. The Students’ Council, however, glared
horror-stricken at the offending article and warned the Editor against publishing similar
articles in the future. But the
Council, feeling that the advice
given to the Daily through the
medium of the Editor had been
ignored, called for the resignation of the person responsible
for the story. The News Edjtor, assuming guilt resigned.
The Council has been misinformed, as preventative action
had already been taken by the
Board. But it was too late to
convene a special meeting thus
the News Editor stood automatically suspended by the terms!
of the motion. The Editor-inChief resigned verbally, in protest of the action. Later he
withdrew his resignation in order
to reconsider. During this reconsidering period the story of
the domestic dispute as told by
the editors, was sent to a number of college papers. Shortly
after the entire Managing board
resigned in protest against the
Council's impulsive action in
suspending the News Editor.
When the Council gained knowledge of the widespread publicity that the Editors had given
the dispute, they indefininitely
suspended the Editors and Managing Board for, resigning without giving fair notice and for
circulating their story of the
dispute, thus jeopardising the
interests of the student body.”

The Lecture System

  

 

THE LECTURE SYSTEM.

Antiquated methods, like antiquated ideas, are remarkably
persisteat—in politics, in economic activity, in theology and
especially in education. For
years, the lecture system has
beea the object of criticism and
condemnation on the part of
educational experts, students.
and even the teachers themselves, but, like a weed, it still
flourishes. We realize that lectures have a legitimate and
useful place in the university,
especially in the few classes for
which it is impossible to secure
adequate texts. Even the lack
of a comprehensive text, however, is absolutely no excuse fir
a professor's dictating notes to
the class. Mimeographed copies Of such notes might be provided. at low cost, and the time
made available might be devoted to discussion of the subject,
or the number of class peiiods
might be reduced. The professors time might be spent to
better advantage if he should
divide his class into two or three
sections each of which would
meét only once a week. Each
student would have to come to
class prepared to discuss a topic
which he had already studied and
to ask questions on points which
he could not quite understand.

Students have been heard to
remark: “Oh, you need not do
the reading that Blank assigns
you. You can get through on
the notes that you get from his
lectures.” The lecturing of the
professors has become too frequently a substitute, instead of a
supplement, for the reading of
the students. The university
would produce more genuine
students with keener and better
informed minds if discussion
took the place of a good deal
of the lecturing and most of the
dictation of notes.

_. reads the comment. . Firstly it settles
no difficulties for France or any other
nation; secondly the ‘‘difficulties’” are
pure impossibilities. M. Herriot's plan
undermines the existence of the French
nation by disarming France and providing for no guarantee of security.
_ It encourages the idea that the military
_ clauses of the Treaty of Versailles be
revised. This is playing directly into
the hands of Germany. We do not
wonder that the von Papen government is particularly pleased by -the
“destructive” plan, since it leads them
to think that France has renounced the
obligations due to her by Germany,
as specified in the Treaty. This is the
German interpretation of the French
plan. Moreover it permits Germany
to rearm at will. The plan abolishes
the Reichsewehr, yes, a corps of
100,000 men, but in return gives the
_ Reich an army of 16 million men, under
the command of the Reichsewehr’s
/ ~~~ Specially trained officers. M. Herriot

iis The plan gives the French people the
fantastic vision of cessation of military
service, Yet it encourages the dreaded
militarism of 1792.
The plan, from a Frenchman’s point
of view, is a plain invitation for invasion. The possibilities of war are in-creased a hundredfold. If France
should strip her defenses, according to
the plan, she would be provoking
Germany to attack her. How long
would it take her Allies to come to her
4 aid? France, who is the most sincere
nation in this project for disarmament,

will offer her, Therefore she keeps

is virtue,” thinks M, Herriot. Every
nation would immediately rise in arms
against her agressor. No wonder that,
when the plan was read to the French
parliament, there was first a moment
of paralyzing stupor and bewilderment,
then came bursts of general hilarity.
The ‘French’ disarmament plan went
to Geneva without the signature of
General Petain and General Weygand
but accompanied by the jeers of the
French nation and parliament.

As a basis of argument the plan is
excellent because Geneva will argue her
head off and get no results. France
will not get her security, England will
keep her navy, the U.S. A. will remain
isolated and unpledged to any agreement and Germany, well Germany will
take this opportunity to rearm,

The questions raised by the ‘‘Comment’’ may be answered simply and
briefly. ‘With what weapons. would
the new armies be equipped?” It has
already been suggested that the disarmed war material be placed at the
disposal of the League of Nations.
“How far will the United States bind
itself to definite responsibilities?’ The
U.S. A’s policy is to remain well isclated, well armed and unpledged. ‘Is
Russia to join in?!’ Russia will sign
no treaties, agreements or pacts. She
excludes herself. ‘‘Are the so called
national contingents to be centralized
or not?” “Comment” your war technique is weak, The Code specifies
centralization. ‘‘Will England take
upon itself new obligations after those
in the Locarno Treaty?’ Why not?
they don’t mean anything.

The author of “Comment” does not
seem to realize the real weaknesses of
the plan, nor its significance to France
and to the other nations. It is those
points I have attempted to explain.

Are there any co-eds who under.
stand the fundamentals of what modern
psychology and physiology have to
offer with regard to the care of chil
dren? Do they understand what the

science of dietetics teaches about the
choice and preparation of food? As
at least eighty per cent of college
women will marry and bear children,
a knowledge of these things is essential
both to the happiness and the weltbeing of the woman and child, not to
mention the poor down-trodden husband. Any intelligent woman would
consider it a necessity to have this
knowledge at least. We believe, in
the light of recent investigation, that
a krtowledge of these subjects is remarkably conspicuous by its absence
as far as the fair “‘students’’ at this
college are concerned.

Besides these subjects, an intelligent
woman should, in our estimation, have
a knowledge and comprehension of the
subjects of importance in the world
today. What do the women at Dalhousie know about such important
controversial. matters as: Agnosticism
as a moral philosophy; The Lytton

The Duff Report; Section 98 of the

Prof. King Gordon
Gives Interesting
Lecture

 

 

Speaking under the auspices
of the Student Christian Movement, professor King Gordon
of McGill University gave the

gain at a more informal meeting in St. Andrew’s Hall. ‘The
Church,” said Professor Gordon,
“has been for long an institution
identified with the established
social and economic order. Today, however, society has broken
down because it is essentially
unchristian. The only alternative to social, economic and
political chaos (preceded, perhaps, by Fascism, said the
speaker, is the conscious, methodical reconstruction of society.”
He challenged students to give
serious consideration to the problems of society, looking toward
the establishment of a new order
based upon truly Christian principles of economic stability and
social justice.

 

and Reparations, and the distinction
between them? Could even a few
Dalhousie co-eds take part in a rational

argument on any of the following sub
jects: The Influence of Hereidty on

the Class System; The Present Family

System with its Hyper-Development

of the Child’s Ego and Emotion, con
trasted with some other System; The

Function of the ‘‘Consumer’s Research

Incorporated”; The Rationalist Society

and its work.

Of course we would not go so far as
to expect a Dal co-ed to understand
Hegel’s influence on the materialistic
interpretation of history, the influence
of Aristotle on the Schoolmen, or to
have read such books as ‘‘The Tragedy
of Waste,” ‘‘Education in the Modern
World,” “Universities—English, German, American,” ‘Surge and Thunder’’.
We could expand this list ad infinitum
but it would only be a waste of valuable
space.

Could a college woman explain why
the term “‘The British Commonwealth
of Nations” is a misnomer— Perhaps
this is a question for the ‘‘purists,’’ and
should be left entirely to the true
metaphysicians, for this is a subject,
among many others, which they may
study but seldom think about outside
the classroom.

Our evidence, gathered by laborious
search, reveals little vestige of knowledge of these subjects among Dal
co-eds, and much less of that comprehension which is essential to intelligent thought. We may be labcuring under a delusion, possibly the intelligent woman’s brain (?) should
busy itself, as is the case among most
Dalhousie co-eds, with the — petty
trivialities of their uninteresting lives.

In order to remedy this deplorable
situation, we are requesting the Editor
to reserve a space in the Gazette through
which the ‘‘equal’’ sex may be informed
of those matters of prime significance
to them in which their ignorance is at
present so evident.

In closing, we wish to explain that
this letter does not come up to our
usual literary standard because we
have been forced to couch our remarks
in the simplest possible language in
order that we might be understood by
the intelligent (?) women of Dalhousie.

time —there will be no radio.
