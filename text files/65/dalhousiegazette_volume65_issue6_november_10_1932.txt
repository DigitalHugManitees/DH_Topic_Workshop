At a recent meeting of Commerce and Engineering, it was
decided 10 hold a joint downtown dance in place of two
separate ones. This decision
was in agreement with the request of ihe Students’ Council
that such a dance be held, and
it is an admirable compromise
between a large number of lavish
hotel affairs and much poorer
but more informal ones staged
exclusively in the Gym. Acommittee was named composed of
George Thompson, Dor Stewart,
Doug. Pyke, H. J. Egan, Commerce and Lou Christie and a
Social Committee, Engineers, to
make arrangements for the dance.
_ Engineers and Commerce are
to be congratulated for the way
they have discarded their very
natural desire for separate and
individual functions in order
that they might co-operate with
the wish of the Students’ Council. We believe, however, that
by so doing they are acting in

sR early twenty years have passed since the assassination of the
Archduke Francis Ferdindnd of Austria at Sarajevo staried 1m

Europe the greatest war which the history of man records.

Today

the world is faced with a crisis far greater than that which confronted
it on that sunny June day in 1914, a crisis which may well prove to
be the ruin of our vaunted civilization, of our cherished liberties.
Few now remain of those who answered the call of their countries

in 1914, and these are slowly passing away.

Itis tous, the young

men and young women who were then mere infants, that the call

Graduates Honour Alma
Mater

Last Saturday afternoon the Graduates of Dalhousie University
assembled within the walls of the new Varsity Gymnasium to inspect,
in a body, this memorial to the far-seeing vision and activity of the
Board of Governors under G. Fred Pearson, the late Chairman.

At this meeting there was passed an unanimous motion that
the Graduates Should bear the initial as well as the interest cost of the

new Gymnasium.

With this action the Alumnae and Alumni of this

University haye once again demonstrated their great loyalty to their

Alma Mater.

Their action involves no small sacrifice, and we know

that the Undergraduates appreciate to the fullest extent this gift of

former Dalhousians.

The assumption of this great financial burden in times of stress
and depression has set a glowing example to those who are to follow:
as undergraduates it is up to us to use this asset for the development
of every side of University life, and when we too take our place in the
ranks of the Alumnae and Alumni, may We not “‘fall by the wayside”
but assume our rightful share in supporting our Alma Mater.

Dal Grads Meet
In New Gym

Asa result of a joint meeting of
the Executive of the Alumnae
and the Alumni a Tea which
was in the nature of a_housewarming al the New Gymnasium
was held on Saturday following
the football game. This was
the first occasion the two groups
have combined to hold such a
function. The guests of which
there were about a hundred,
made a tour of inspection of the
building expressing much interest in the Alumni Room.

Tea was served by the Executive. Mr. R. E: Inglis, President of the Alumni called the
meeting to order and asked
Miss Eileen Burns to outline
the purpose of the meeting.
Miss Burns welcomed the guests
and briefly explained that the
executive of the two bodies had
decided to ask the members if
they would acept a _ proposal
to assist in raising funds to
help pay the debt on ithe Gymnasium. .

A number of loyal Dalhousians voiced their approval of
the suggestion. At the conclusion of which the meeting
heartily endorsed the plan to
canvass Dal graduates for subscriptions to cover a five year
period.

C. O. T .C. Holds

Fine Parade

The turnout..at ‘‘A’’. Company’s parade last Wednesday
was much better than heretofore,
but it still leaves something to
be desired. Many of the cadets
have expressed their approval
of the new company regulations
which exempt them from wearing breeches and puttees.. They
are able now to change to civilian
clothes without much trouble if
they wish to go anywhere after
the parade.

Lieut. Clarke of the R. C. R.
began lectures last night for
both ‘‘A” and “B” certificates.
“B” certificate lectures will be
[held in the Arts Building every
Wednesday night at 8.00 p. m.,
and ‘‘A”’ certificate lectures will
be given at 9.00 p. m. These
lectures are both interesting and
useful, and those who wish to
write their examinations in the
Spring should make it a point
to attend all of them.

As we said last week, there is
still time to join up, and it is
hoped that many more will
realize the benefits which are
gained from this work, benefits,
it may be emphasized, which
cannot be gained in any other
way. Surely those who joined
the unit last year can find
enough time to turn out.

FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 18th.

Saturday, Dal and Wanderers
met in the crucial game of the
league as well as to decide the
better team. With the Tigers
walking off the field victors
by a score of 3-0, the question
seems settled with the Tigers the
winner in both meetings. The
ligers are now set to play Acadia
for the League title.

After ‘‘O Canada” Dal kicked
ofi and the game was on. A
beautiful backfield run by the
Reds was stopped by Davidson
who tackled Finlay hard on
Dal’s 15 ydline. ‘The Reds were
forcing play but seemed unable
to solve Dal’s defensive play in
their own defensive area. Both
teams were guilty of many transgressions and many penalties
were the rule. Sheppard, Dal,
and Young, Hamilton, Reds
tried place kicks but missed.
As the period grew older the
teams indulged in runs and kicking duels that had the spectators
as excited as the players. The
Reds attempts to score were
foiled by the Tigers backfield
beating the Reds at _ their
own game. Led by Thompson
the Tigers backfield forced the
play back to center field as the
period ended.

As the second period started
the effects of the game were beginning to show on both teams
but there was no let up in the
bruising play. The Tigers rushed the ball deep into the Reds
territory where scrum after
scrum was formed. The wind
was playing havoc with the Reds
high punts and often returned
them almost to the kicker. Both
teams lost a man when frayed
tempers snapped and a fight
started, but the fighters were
banished by the Referee and the
game proceeded. The Reds

BILINGUALISM AT DALHOUSIE.

Under the title—‘‘One Nation, Two Cultures,” the Canadian
Nation discussed the vital question of the French-Canadian problem. The existence of two races, two languages, two cultures
in the Dominion of Canada is a fact but how can a single, united
nation exist on the basis of that fact? How can we combine a
common love for home and soil with two languages, two cultures?

The ideal of MacDonald and Cartier at Confederation was
‘one nation, two cultures, one nationality, two languages, one
loyalty, two races ’’ and this should be the ideal of every true
Canadian today. Moreover the friendly and equitable relationships between the two great races must be fostered on the principle
that each race is equally entitled to ‘express and preserve its own
identity and culture.”’ Racial discord, such as has arisen, must be
eliminated by a more complete understanding of the aims, cultures
and ideals of each race by the other.

Within our college we have one organization whose aim points
By the presentation in French of short French
plays, French songs and recitations, Le Cercle Francais is furthering, to no small extent, so great a cause. Last year under Professor

- Martin, Le Cercle Francais forged ahead with nearly sixty mem
bers and presented a score or more of short, French plays. This

year the Cercle is under the expert direction of Professor Gautheron.

ization deserves the wholehearted support of every student, for
aes racial problem not only arises in Quebec but also in our own
ovince of Nova Scotia. The French Club does indeed fill a

a common loyalty.
ELECTIONS AND ALL THAT.

Every night for weeks we have heard speeches from leaders in
the great political battle in the United States. We have heard
over the radio the cheers of mass meetings and political rallies.
The thing which strikes us the most is that the enthusiasm of the
American people is sincere. We have noticed the interest with
which the Americans have taken up this great campaign.

This leads us to think of the condition of politics within Dalhousie. As everyone knows University politics have been at a very
low ebb during the last few years. The body by which we are
governed has at times been composed of students who have been
elected because they are ‘“‘good fellows” and not for anything that
they might do to help Dalhousie. Platform politics are unknown.
We have degenerated to a “popularity contest” the most popular man
being elected and in many cases he is the man with the leastability
to carry on the business of student affairs.

The causes of this frightful condition are, we feel, the amazing
in differencejof the students themselves, and the interference of
groups which have no right to meddle with University politics. The

~ result is that only through the determination of undergraduates in
terested in sport the University has been able to turn out teams
that would not disgrace the name of Dalhousie. It is through
pluck and perseverance that a few men have succeeded in being
chosen for University teams in spite of the forces working against
them.
The fault lies in the attitude of “laissez-faire’’ which the
Students of Dalhousie take in regard to such matters.
If the Students would take more active interest in their own
welfare it would be comparatively easy to remedy the interference
of outside cliques, which are now weakening University spirit.

TWELVE THINGS TO REMEMBER.

Marshall Field has given us, amongst other contributions
to the literature of our generation, many thoughtful remarks which
deserve the utmost consideration. One of these is entitled—
“Twelve Things to Remember’; and in twelve short phrases he
had embodied the fundamentals of a happy, successful life.

The first is the value of time; the success of perseverance;
the pleasure of working; the dignity of simplicity; the worth of
character; the power of kindness; the influence of example; the

_ obligation of duty; the wisdom of economy; the virtue of patience;

the improvement of talent; and the joy or originating.”
Time is all precious; and if its valued moments are wasted,

they can never be recovered. What high rewards perseverance

so yields! It alone, is the keynote of success. ‘Simplicity is an

exact medium between too little and too much.” How often we

search fruitlessly for this happy medium, but we find it in taking
delight in simple things.
ae ip all, and the world will make room for a man who possesses such.

_A sterling character, and a firm, decisive spirit is recognized by

With it come kindness, patience and duty; and the strength to set
an example of your ideals. The world is indeed better for having
such an individual; he is the one, who, by diligence, will improve
i ee oa e, and lead his fellow companions to higher and
etter goals. ae: .

Germany and Geneva.

The refusal of Germany to
join in a Four-Power Conference
whose object would be to propose means by which the common work of the Disarmament
Conference within the League
of Nations might be effectively
resumed, has been met with
many shades of criticism, especially from the French press.
The ‘‘Temps” a leading French
paper says that “It is the subtle
policy inaugurated in the German communication of August
20 on equality of armaments”
which is behind the refusal, and
this pretty well sums up the
French criticism. However,
there is another side to the
question. Many acute critics
point out that what Germany
objects to is not the Conference,
but Geneva, because being held
at Geneva, the Conference would
be nothing more than a _ sub
committee of the Disarmament
Conference tiself. It thus appears that the German refusal is
categorical.

—_—

 

Eastern Europe.

Someone has lately written
a book called ‘The Tinder Box
of Asta—Manchuria’ ; one might,
with as much justice, be written
called Yugo-Slavia’ The Tinder
Box of Eastern Europe.’ The
interest of the Western reader
is concentrated on Geneva and
Manchuria; consequently, recent
happenings in Danubia and the
Balkans have passed by without
us realizing their full significance.
These agrarian debtor countries
have time and time again defaulted on foreign obligations,
and cut salaries and pensions,
because the interest rates which
they agreed to pay were contracted when agricultural produce was two or three times
higher in price than today. In
Hungary, General Gombos, a
violent semi-Fascist, is in power:
in Greece the Premier M. Veniselos, is encountering stiff opposition; the Albanian regime
is on the verge of collapse.
Most important is the danger of
collapse in Yugo-Slavia which
might easily precipitate a war
in Europe. Here the Croats
and Slovenes who have found
the Serbs no better masters than
the Magyars and who are systematically excluded from many
positions, are rising in armed
rebellion against their oppressors
Will the Governments of Europe
stand idly aside and watch the
powder magazine explode?

A Real University.

Those who have read Dr.
Abraham Flexner’s stirring book
on Universivies will be interested
in the new institute for advanced
study of which he is the head.
The new iristitute is protected
against those destructive influences which were so strongly condemned in that book—namely—
wasteful duplication, emphasis
on mere size and numbers, vocational courses, etc. The plan is
simply this: To found an institution of learning and nothing
more. No professors will be
appointed except as the right
men are found and it is an indication of the high standard of
scholarship which will be demanded that the Department
of’ Mathematics is to have as
its head the most eminent mathematician in the world—Dr. Albert Einstein.

Co-operation.

Anti-Feminist League.

Co-operation.

Engineers and Commerce have
shown a true spirit of co-operar
tion and have taken steps to
combine their annual dances.
They have worked together as was
was suggested by the Council
and we feel that their efforts
will not be in vain. Many
people are continually talking
about Dalhousie spirit but we
feel that this is something that
may be classed as something
just a little finer than the ‘‘rahrah”’ type such as encouraged at
some colleges. When two strong
societies such as the Engineers
and Commerce put their personal
likes aside and pull together for
the common good there must
be something worthy of congratulation. We feel that the
dance sponsored by these two
organizations will receive the
hearty support of the student
body.

This year we have advanced
from the stupid ideas of the past
few years and we have succeeded
in reducing the number of large
expensive hotel dances and it

now appears that we will only}
have three or four at the most.!

This is indeed a great step towards bringing university life
down toearthagain. The dances of the past have been little
more than large social gatherings
giving a false impression of
university life.

Anti-Feminist League.

It is rumoured that an AntiFeminist League is to be formed
at Dalhousie as a result of. the
outspoken opinions of the Co-eds.

The point which the sponsors!) suse he

of this group wish to put before
the University is that in regard
to University dances the girls
have nothing whatever to say
in the matter. This apparently
is the chief reason for the organization of this group. The
Anti-Feminists feel that the Coeds of Dalhousie should remember that they are not the only
girls eligible to be escorted to
dances. There are several thousand other very attractive young
ladies in the City. The group
feels that Co-eds are at the University as “silent partners,” and
as such are not in any position
to say what is to be done or
what is not to be done.

The men responsible for the
organization of the League hope
to be able to furnish the Gazette
with further information in the
near future. We look forward
to it eagerly.

It is felt by many that greater
interest in the drama_ should
be shown at Dalhousie. With
this in mind let us try to base
our appreciation of the stage
and screen upon something more
than mere superficial entertainment. Let us learn, for example
to recognize the merits and
flaws of the direction, photography, acting, and sound of a
particular talkie, and not be
deceived by a mediocre production, cloaked with screaming
advertisements and trailers. Let
us watch for sincer and natural
acting, censure weak plots, and
inconsistent motivation, and in
turn gain something to substantiate our opinion of a film or
play, as the case may be.

Bring Home the Goal Posts.

Quite a scene took place recently on the McGill football
field, immediately following the
defeat of the McGill team by
Queens University. A small
band of Kingstonians, living up
to an old American custom,
rushed on the field and tore down
the goal posts at one end of the
stadium. The McGill fans rally
ing at the double insuli, flocked
on to the field. The Queen's
men were outnumbered five to
one and afjter dragging the posts
a short way. they abandoned
them, (which reminds me, Dal’s
goal posts have been painted.
Have you seen them)? A wild
free-for-all ensued and punishment was meted out to both
sides; especially to the Queen’s
supporters, who returned home
somewhat battle scarred.

Beardless Men.

From Kingston comes the
news that a doctor has at last
dsicovered a method for treating
a man’s face, so that never
thereafter will it be necessary
for him to shave. The treat(ment which consists of exposing
' the face to certain rays has been
most successful, it is claimed.
It this is true, then he has discovered a great boon to mankind.
This doctor’s discovery will be
received with an open heart, by
the man who has to shave every
‘day of his life to suppress his
beard. But the fuzzy faced

t . . .
;youth will speak disparagingly

of this Medical benefactor. The
up and coming young man is
very proud when he first begins
to scrape his features and commits himself 1o the daily use of
the razor. His joy is boundless
is old enough to
shave but he does not stop to
consider that he -has started
something that he will never
be able to finish.

Nov. 2. The report of the
Committee on Studies was accepted. Since some difficulty
is being encountered as to ways
of spending the financial surplus
of the Society, the two suggestions, that books be bought and
that men from outside points
be brought to lecture before the
Society, were made.

A motion That we hold our
dance down town” being seconded, carried.

 

 

 

Delta Gamma To
Hold Tea Dance

On Sat., Nov. 19th, the Delta
Gamma Society will hold a Tea
Dance at Shirreff Hall in aid or
The Community Chest. Fof
several years the girls have been
doing this and will probably
continue the custom.

This year Mr. Joe Mills has
kindly consented to play for
the Tea Dance and for this he
deserves much credit and he
should certainly get the patronage of all Dalhousie Societies as
Mr. Mills is a busy man and an
afternoon means much to him.

ity.
Gentlemen :—

I] have examined the accounts of
your treasurer and have found them
complete in every respect. I was
particularly impressed with the great
mass of records which were available
for checking the accounts. In past
years it has been necessary to assume
any number of things in this checking
process, but this year, thanks to an
improved system and to the care and
accuracy with which the work was
handled, every bit of nécessary information was easily available. All
accounts were correct.

I have one suggestion to offer. It
might be advantageous to have a
separate book for each different student activity. At present the accounts are all kept in the same book,
the form of the book being a great
improvement over the old system, but
still having a disadvantage. It might
be confusing to a new treasurer or a
different auditor. Further, I believe
it would be easier to get detailed information quickly if each activity had
its own book to be kept by the treasurer.

One more point I wish to mention
may not be within my proper sphere,
I had an excellent opportunity last
year to see just how much work there
is to the treasurer's job. It would be
impossible to have a student handle
the work—there is too much of it
And it would be equally impossible
to assign it to any man who has a
full-time job—too much work and too
many personal calls at odd hours of
the day and night. You are particularly fortunate in being able to have
the services of your present treasurer
who just happens to be able to give
the time necessary for the work. It
is almost a full-time job in itself. And
I wish to call to your attention the fact
that a great deal of your money has
been saved in the past year through
the thoroughness and the care with
which he handled the work.

Very truly yours,

JAMES M. MacDONALD.

me, (for Egbert is considered
so by some of our coeds), could
I suggest-a thought which has
been in my mind —that is
the abolishment of the council.
In its place, a form of council or
government patterned after our
own House of Commons with
the formation of two or more
parties, should be substituted.
In this way, we would have the
majority of the students behind
the party in power, and also do
away with the present cut-throat

 
   
  
 
    
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
   
 

the whole student body, as well
as a valuable political training
for all the students.

In summing up, the only conclusion we can reach is that the
Council has failed us, and whether they will carry on lacking
student support remains to be
seen. Thanking you for your
space, Mr. Editor, and complimenting you upon your fearless and unbiased stand, I am,

Sincerely yours,
EGBERT.

PHI DELTA EPSILON

Once again, Phi Delta Epsilon
Fraternity proved its ability to
come to the front, when on
Friday they staged a most successful dance at the home of
Mr. and Mrs. J. Glube. About
twenty couples danced to the
music of Don Murray and his
orchestra, who rendered a variety of dance hits unsurpassed
in Rythm and melody.

Mr. Harry Handler, of Jersey
City, U. S. A.; was recently
initiated into the fraternity.

Woe unto their parents for

hied himself unto the halls of
Stud and lo, he came within
the confines of the domain of
Herbie, the Wise.

8. There he beheld the son
of Stewart speaking unto the
men and women, saying—

9. Look ye, for all S verily
it is the letter P. Eeegee, all
Professors of logheec are descendants of Skutland, and thus
he spake on and his words were

witty and the populace echoed
with ribald laughter and the
mighty Herb smiled unto him
self; yea verily, ‘tis the same

10. Now on a certain day
there came together the warriors
of Wand and did go in battle
with the men of Dal, and lo,
there was also there a great
multitude.

11. And the sound of the fife

the beating of drums. For there
stood the mighty bandsman,

14, And lo, this warrior was
most valiant in the thickest of
battle and he led the onslaught
fiercely and struck terror into
the hearis of the heroes of
Wand, so that they were completely routed from one end of
the field unto the other. And
the populace hailed .Dave of
Med as a hero.

16. Then the people thronged onto the streets and there
was a jubilant procession with
rejoicing and drunken orgies, for

Tennis Club

——

- Tennis was started at Dalhousie at the request of a number of enthusiasts around town,
who said that it was a good game
and ought therefore to be played
by college students. We replied: of course tennis is an
excellent game for students at
college, but how do you expect
us to play without courts, and
how would you like to play
tennis in winter? Why, only
the other day I was called a
brute because I told the Dal.
tennis team to play Acadia al
Wolfville, and one of the girls
got frost-bitten in the middle of
the third set.

Well, that would not satisfy
our tennis fans, so last year we
asked the Carleton Tennis Club,
who built their courts on University property and do not pay
any rent for it, if we might try
out something on their premises.
If you don’t at first succeed,
try, try again.

We have already succeeded
during our two years of existence.
Did Dalhousie not run away
with the intercollegiate tennis
championship last year, and are
we not so far ahead this year
that it would take a skilled
mathematician to compute the
difference between our nearest

college competition in the Mari-|
Nov.|times and ourselves? And as

means, being interpreted, “In

one-eyed manis king.” Inother
words we must seek bigger
game, if we are to live up to the
standard of a major sport.

So, on we go next year to
greater and more ambitious undertakings. At present, there
are clubs in the province of
Nova Scotia — particularly in
Halifax—which can defeat the
Dalhousie team, but now that
the D. A. A. C. has made tennis
a major sport, the game is
bound to become stronger and
more popular every year. ‘Good
stuff!’ a High School student
exclaimed on being informed
that tennis now received a full
D at Dalhousie, ‘‘when I go to
Dalhousie I’m going to try and
make the team myself.”

And as for the young lady who
was frost-bitten in the third set,
surely we can manage to start
and finish earlier in future years.
By the bye, there is a meeting
arranged for 2 p.m. on December 26 in Truro, when representatives from U. N. B., Mount
Allison, Acadia and Dalhousie
will deliberate on ways and
means of accelerating events in
1933.

P. S.—On showing above to
the Preisdent of the Dalhousie
Tennis Club, I was asked whether a few facts might not be useful. Here they are: Dalhousie
played Mount Allison twice and
Acadia once in 1982. Out of a
total of 42 matches played Dalhousie won 35. Mount Allison

'won 13 out of 46 matches, and

Acadia 10 out of 26. I was also
informed that my comments on
the standard of tennis at our
sister universities were none too
complimentary.

Let me therefore conclude by
saying that both Mount Allison
and Acadia gave us a wonderful
time and that Dalhousie played
splendid tennis to win the intercollegiate championship for the
second year in sucession. [|
feel sure, however, that our
friends at Acadia and Mount
Allison will not resent the suggestion that tennis is not yet
receiving the attention at our
Maritime colleges which it undoubtedly deserves.

Letter to Forum
Says Egbert Spoke Everlasting Truth

 

The Editor, :
Dalhousie Gazette,
Halifax, N. S.

Dear Sir— }

The letter of Egbert came to
me through _our paper. My
presumptuousness in attempting a reply to a missive of such
humour, such accuracy, such
irony, may find some excuse
in my ignorance. Realizing to
the fullest extent my incompetency, clearly apprehending
the futility of destroying great
and everlasting truths, I write;
not on behalf, nor in defence, of
those who were so effectively
attacked—but write hoping that
from so great a stream of wisdom, perhaps still will flow the
water for parched throats.

I, undoubtedly, lack that
charm, that personality, that
something possessed by my more
favoured brother. Surely there
must be some satisfaction in being compelled to take a girl to a
dance. My unfortunate circumstance placed me on a plane,
where I made my own decision,
then forced me to depend on the
charity and kindness of some
young lady for company. Now,
the light shines clean through
a cloudless sky. I stand alone.
My position is unique. With
my expectant eyes turned toward the rising sun I pray that
the new day will bestow on me
bounteous gifts of foreign character, to make me too a popular
idol. Tonight I shall take my
place in the vanguard of that
fearless army marching, past the

ae
oo’

tyranny of woman, to ultimate
right. I shall not then have to
subjugate my silly pride.

Let me pass over.these things
and come to the chapter on
moral philosophy, on wives, on
mothers, on conscience. Let me
come to the “egotistical ones,”’
yea even to the egoistical ones,
those selfish, non-altruistic,
pleasure-seeking despots — to
that great class doomed to the
bottomless pit of horror by all
decency. Their fate is justly
deserved, for they spoke, saying
—we prefer to dance at the
hotel—truly a dastardly transgression. Never shall they know
the true happiness of chubby
baby, never shall they see the
smiling dimpled cheeks, never
shall they experience the honest
innocence of those beautiful eyes.
Alas, let us not remain.

Mr. Editor, will you kindly
excuse my extreme want of
first-hand knowledge on the subject of “good neckers” and
‘“petters.’ It is a morass far
from the home where I laboured
in darkness. Oh, had I but
understood the chatter of the
magpie, the gossip of the jay,
had I but listened to the inane
babbling braggadocio of the heroes worn, but rich: in conquest,
I too might know, might make
to laugh the boys with vivid
descriptions, but--I have failed
—utterly — —completely — unforgivably.

Euphemistically yours,

GA.

Theme Wanted

Mr. Donald Murray, prominent musician, has recently perfected a waltz score for a new
song which he hopes will be
made one of Dalhousie’s songs.
- Mr. Murray, or Don as we
better know him, is asking for
a title for his new song—the
title to represent the theme of
the song. The words are as yet
unwritten and Don is seeking
inspiration. Send in your suggestions to Don through the
Gazette.

Things are looking rosy for
Doug Murray these days. Doug
is the energetic leader that handles the baton in the Dal band,
and he certainly is not sparing
the horses” in putting his band
on the map. By the co-operation and earnestness of its seventeen members, the band is now
really organized, and is already
looking for new worlds to conquer.

Organizing a band is not the
simplest thing in the world when
you haven’t any money, and
very few instruments which are
not in the best of condition, but
this is exactly the situation that
Mr. Murray and his band had
to combat with. You haven't
heard the boys crabbing because they got the ‘razz’ now
and then instead of a word of
congratulation. At last the
Students’ Council are beginning
to sit up and take notice, realizing that the band and its leader
are in earnest and are trying to
instil some of that “rah-rah”
spirit that is so lacking at Dal.

Negotiations are now under
way with the C. O. T. C. to sign
the band up, and I think the

‘i may | oye
If he stood military leaders are to be con
gratulated on such a move-for
it will not only improve their
unit, but keep the bang together
after it has been organized so
efficiently.

With unselfish motives behind
such an organization, I think it
is up to all Dalhousians to give
the band our heartiest support,
and when you hear the trombonist missing a slide, remember
boys, that Rome wasn’t build
in-a day.”

Dear Sir:—

In order ‘‘to make both ends
meet”’ the fees at Dalhousie were
raised this year. It is readily
understood why the fees in the
chemistry department were raised. The costly apparatus and
chemicals are no doubt the cause.

But why Commefce classes?
It is true that the Gommerce
students do use the library a
gréat deal. But do they use it
any more than the students in
Economics or English. Still the
Commerce classes were ten dollars more.

Why should all the burden be
placed on this department, where
the classes are compulsory? Why
not on optional classes, or raise

Mr. Editor :—
Not long ago, in MacLean’s

Mr. Editor:

In reply to Egbert’s letter in
the Gazette of Nov. 2nd, may I
point out a few errors. The
Dalhousie girls realize as well as.
as the boys that there is a
Depression. Mr. Egbert has
pointed out some extra expenses
incurred by Hotel Dances. May
I explain that these are not
extra.

I.. The dances are only a
quarter extra—for the professional students the price is $2.00.

II. Cigarettes- Well, as far
as I've noticed, the smoking
doesn’t cease at the gym, and
is carried on in less comfortable
circumstances.

III. How about the taxiThe gym dances require a taxi
just as much as the Hote
Dances. Not ali the Dal girls
live at the Hall, you know, and
even the Hall girls are averse to
walking on rainy or snowy nights

[V. Did you ever realize, Mr.
Egbert, that there is an edict
out that Dal Students cannot
have rooms at the Hotel? Which
cuts out the supposed $4.50
expense.

V. Who? I ask you, is going
to appear at a formal gym
dance minus a tux? Try and
count them, Mr. Egbert.

I’m really not for or against
Dal Hotel Dances. I know it’s
really the boys’ matter because
they pay. But, Mr. Egbert,
I can’t allow you to state such
glaring errors. Try again, Egbert.

Thank you, Mr. Editor.

DALHOUSIE GIRL.

U. K. C. Notes

What a Siiatess the Kingsmen
had on Hallowe’en! The gathering began quietly enough with
games of bridge, but soon developed into a hilarious assembling of practically the entire
male student body. The oldtime sport of ducking for apples
was revived and for a while the
a “all wet” but very
lively. The card games and

by Lady Lena Terrington, an
English noblewoman, and she
has, I think made many a
ments which apply to some of
our Dalhousie co-eds. The coeds in question recently appeared
in print under the nom-de-plume
of “‘Dalhousie’s Dream Girls.”’
A few clippings from the article
might not, perhaps, be amiss.

Lady Terrington says, ‘‘Canadian men do treat their women
too well..... They have made
their women idols and are too
clean-souled to see the feet of
clay.”’ The cause of this existing condition the author attributes to the hardships of pioneer
days, “Then man made a promise—to his women and his God.
He would make all this up to
her when the world was a
smoother place. He has kept
his bargain—and she has failed.”’

“This is the trouble with
many of the women over here.
They have always had too much
and they still expect it.’

“The majority of women over
here are selfish. They demand
and it is not up to a woman to
demand. Basically it is wrong.
Man is the stronger animal and
woman should be the complement. She should accept gratefully and graciously, and if she
has any sense, she will know
that there are more ways than
one of killing a cat.’’

Hiss at the above if you will,
girls, but allow me to remind you
that it was not written by an
egotistic male. The author is
one of your own sex, a woman
whose experience has, no doubt,
been wider than any of you will
ever possess. Thus you are condemned from your own ranks.

Mind you, Mr. Editor, I am
not defending gym dances, nor
advocating hotel hops. But
there is no doubt that, on the
basis of the greatest good to the
greatest number, we must select
the gym. On the other hand, if
a good time is to be had by all,
it seems as if we must negotiate
with the Lord Nelson or the
Nova Scotian.

But to return to the girls, who
were so brazen as to voice an
opinion upon a- matter which is
no concern of theirs. Don’t you
think, my dears, that you flattered yourselves just a little too
much when you adopted the pen
name, “‘Dalhousie’s Dream
Girls’? Verily, I say, if such be
the substance of Dalhousie’s
dreams, then may Heaven help
us!

   
    
  
   
   
   
 
 
 
 
   
  
   
  
 
 
 
 
    
   
 
 
    
   
 
   
  

 

    
     
    
      
  
  

volume of sound. An attempt
was made to organize a squaredance but the general excitement was too great to permit
any stately steps, so several
men gave solo exhibitions of
personal agility. After thoroughly enjoying the refreshments
the students united whole-heartedly in singing College songs.

The evening’s entertainment
ended with ghost stories, of the
best Hallowe’en nature, being
told in the fading light from the
fireplace.

 

Sincerely yours,

A MERE MALE.

 

 

The men interested in basketball held a meeting on Thursday,
November 8rd, and hours were
arranged for practices. Staff.
Tanton is manager this year
and Glen Smith is captain. A
large number of men attended
and, if their enthusiasm means
anything, the team from Kings
will be no mean opponent this
year.

 

Pine Hill Notes.

Student body meetings are
disclosing unexpected evidences
of experts in Constitutional procedure. If Dr. MacKay should
need any assistance with his
Political Science Classes we
could recommend Horace Henson, Doc Bruce and Don Christie.

 

The Haliburton Club, on October 29th, provided an excellent
programme for over forty students. Great literary and oratorical talent was shown by the
speakers of the evening—-Messrs.
Wainwright, Cleveland and
Cochran. ‘The. quality of the
material read was commended
by the President, Professor Bennett. The second part of the
programme consisted of fine refreshments, and the King’s and
Haliburton toasts were honoured.

Tennyson is at last achieving
a real appreciation within our
sacred halls. We know of one
Cape Bretoner who breathes
feeling of Clarabel as he goes
through his daily motions. Is
it poetry or the fall weather,
Charlie?

  
  

The railway situation in Canada has been serious, but we are
confident that there is no longer
any need to worry. Howard
Kennedy is going to help the

. N. R. break even next year
with all these week-ends in
Truro.

 

The King’s College Co-eds
Club elected their officers for
|the year, on Oct. 29th. Miss
Cecily Kirby was chosen president, Mrs. Wilcox, vice-president Miss Fran. MacDonald,
secretary and Miss Kay Tilton;
treasurer. The entertainment
at this meeting was in the form
of a skit put on by the freshettes.

The Dean’s Round Table conducted by Professor Thompson
on current topics is proving very
popular with the residents. The
latest trends of society and
politics are discussed, and the
keen interest displayed rather
gives the lie to the contention
that college students are not
interested in current affairs.

  

The student body of Kings has
chosen Thursday, November 17
as the date for the Student Body
dance. A committee has been
elected and the students expect
a real dance.

The Editor,
The Dalhousie Gazette,
Dear Sir—

With reference to a _ letter
which appeared in the columns
of your excellent journal last
week over the signature of one,
Darrow Blandford.

Might I remind that gentleman that “the men who should
be directing their attention to
policies and schemes whith
would alleviate the situation”
are doing so. In fact they are
doing nothing else for twentyfour hours a day, every day of
the week. If M. LaVergne
chooses to procrastinate that is
his business, and the business
ot the people of his constituency.

Mr. Woodsworth represents a
minority of the people of Canada
and he has few followers in the

 

Minister himself. Nor should
they, for Mr. Woodsworth has
many other things to attend to,
while the Prime Minister can and
does give his whole time to
those very matters. Only one
who has worked in close proximity to Mr. Bennett can realize
how true this is, and I venture
to say that Mr. Blandford does
not possess these qualifications.
[ say these things in order to
correct any false impressions
which may have been made on
the susceptible minds of those
who read the Gazette, and I
hope that I have accomplished
my purpose.
‘Thanking you for this space,
I am, Sir,
Yours very truly
TOM BROWN.

Dawson Club

Makes Field Trip

The Dawson Geology Club
went on a _ higly interestng,
entertaining and successful field
trip on Saturday, October 29.
With Dr. Douglas as their leader,
they piled into the several cars
procured for the occasion and
were off to a fine start. The
car containing the worthy presideni of the Club was, however,
rather unfortunate in getting
under way and unforseen circumstances prevented the car
and its passengers from reaching
their goal. It was observed later, that at least they got as far
as Bedford, but there came to
grief. Ah well, such things do
happen!

The rest of the party got there,
however. There being Grand
Lake, about thirty-one miles
from Halifax. They inspected
a very interesting ruin of Araeonite and procured some other
specimens of rocks.

The highlight of the trip was
a visit to the home of Mr. Horne,
a very interesting man who was
formerly a prospector. Two fire
places in house, made up of
seventy kinds of rocks were
objecis of wonder and admiration to the members of the party
and they were very closely examined by several interested
OTLES.

Then came the real party.
A fire was built in spite of the
wind, and Percy put the kettle
on and we all had tea. Percy,
that is Mr. Sheppard, poured
tea very dextrously while Mr.
Fred Morrison surprised all by
his ability to make delicious ham
sandwiches. Personally, we
never thought he had it in him,
but he has proved himself. —

We were very privileged in-!
deed to have with us Mr. Doug- |
las and Miss Todd. Our Honorary President, Doctor Macintosh; Mr. Dugald MacGillivray |
and Professor Todd were also
members of the party.

Playing in the Dalhousie Interfaculty League at Studley
Friday, the Law football team
defeated Commerce 10 to 0 to
give them their first victory and
to place them in second position
in their section of the league.

The Lawyers scored one try in
each period, with Roy MacDonald converting both to make the
total 10, and at the same time
kept the Commerce fifteen from
crossing their goal line.

In the first period Jerry Coleman for Law opened the scoring,
when on a line run, he crashed
the line to place the ball near
the posts, Roy MacDonald added two more, when he kicked
the convert between the posts to
make the total five to nothing
for the Lawyers. There was no

more scoring in this half although both teams were on
several occasions close to the

goal line, but were unable to
score.

Herb Grant, of the Law threequarter line, added three more
points when he crossed the
Commerce line and again Roy
MacDonald kicked the convert.
There was no further scoring
during the remainder of the

game and the Law team by
virtue of their win went into
second place, one game behind
the Medical team in their section
