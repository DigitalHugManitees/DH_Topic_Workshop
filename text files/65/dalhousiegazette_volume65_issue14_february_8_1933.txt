Dean Corbett Of

McGill to Speak

The career of Dean Corbett,
who is to be the next lecturer
in the Dalhousie series, makes
interesting reading. Though an
‘Tslander’’ he received his education in Quebec. Winning an
Entrance Scholarship of one
thousand dollars he studied Classics and History at McGill, and
became a Rhodes Scholar. ~He
was an officer at the front and
saw long service in the War,
winning the Military Cross. He
is the only Canadian who ever
became a Fellow of All Souls,
Oxford. He was one of the
legal advisers of the Labor Office,
League of Nations, 1922-24. He
is now Professor of Roman Law,
and Dean of the Law Faculty in
McGill University. For several
years he was Chairman of the
Institute. of Politics, Williams
College. Two of his books have
been published by the Oxford
University Press. Having spoken to Halifax audiences in the
past, Dean Corbett is known as
a clear and forcible speaker,
with definite views about public
affairs. His subject next Friday
evening will be: ‘How Roman
Law still influences the World.”’

 

Notice

To the Student Body:

The Senate has asked for the
co-operation of the Students
with regard to smoking in the
corridors and halls of the various
University buildings. The regulations covering this matter
is apparently not common knowledge, or it has been forgotten
by the Student Body.

There is a smoking room in
every building where smoking
is permitted and signs are posted
where smoking is prohibited.
The Council of Students therefore requests the Student Body
to tulfill the wishes of the Senate
by observing this regulation.

It is a time honored legislation
that any infringement of this
ruling is reported by the University Faculty to the Council
of Students and a fine of Two
Dollars ($2.00) isimposed on the
o ffender.

W. C. MacKENZIE,
Pres. Council of Students

 

All those who have not
yet paid their subscriptions to the Gazette are
urgently requested to do
so at once, as the Gazette
needs your support.

 

 

All Dalhousie ought to be very
pleased to hear that Betty March
Dalhousie and Margaret Leonard, Acadia, who debated with
a team at McGill, Friday night
won by a unanimous decision
of the judges. The subject was
“That Canada is over-governed.’’ Miss March, who is leader of the team has had a short
but colourful debating career.
She was a member of the team
that went to Mount Allison last
year. She has spoken several
times at Sodales and was this
year made Girls’ Debating Manager. We are glad she was
given this marvellous opportunity and hope her success
continues throughout her trip.

The debate at McGill was
rightfully won by the Nova
Scotians. They were debating
the affirmative of the resolution
and in one sense a difficult subject to debate. Their main
points were that there are too
many legislatures, and too many
legislations. They both spoke
exceptionally well and showed
the true Maritime spirit.

 

 

Dal Defeats Mt. A.

In Exciting Game:

—

The Dal Tigers playing under
the inspired leadership of Captain Sam Fairstein decisively defeated the Mt. Allison hoopsters
36 to 29 in an exhibition match
last Thursday night. Playing
in the new Studley gym before
a crowd of over two hundred
the Dal team put on a miraculous second period spurt that
overcame a six point lead and
turned what looked like certain
defeat into a glorious victory.
Mt. A. with the veteran outfit
that won the _ intercollegiate
crown a year ago completely
outclassed Dalhousie during the
first half and with Austin, Brodie.
Andrews, and Smith working
pretty combination plays, built
up a well deserved 17 to 11
lead before the first halt ended.

The second half was another
story. With Anderson and Musgrave playing a stellar defensive
game, with very pretty backchecking assistance from the
forward line of Bauld, Crease
and Fairstein, the Dal team
completely smothered the Mt.
A. attack holding it to four
field goals during the last 20
minutes. On the other hand
the fast breaking same forward
line got the jump on the Mt. A.
forward line time and again to
catch the two Mt. A. guards
alone and to work the ball in
close to score. Fairstein with a
tricky overhead shot was especially effective dropping in
five baskets while the other
two corralled three apiece. Five
minutes after the second half
started the score was tied at
19 all and after that Dal forged
ahead to stay. Five minutes to
go Mt. A. put on a spurt and
came within one point of Dal
at 29 to 28 but the Tigers last
drive that netted three quick
baskets was too much for the
Mt. A. team which kad slowed
up considerably and Dal walked
off with a well deserved victory.

Mt. Allison — Welsh, Brodie
5, Austin 5, Hyiski, Smith 2

Mr. Lloyd George on Liberals.
The other day, on the

L|occasion of his 70th birthday,

Mr. Lloyd George was asked a
rather suggestive question—
namely, what, in his opinion,
was preventing the Liberal leaders from crossing the floor of the
House of Commons. The reply
was characteristic of the man:
“1 am afraid it is because ninetenths of these members are
dependent on Tory votes for
their seats. They are apprehensive lest they should forfeit

_A.| the support of the Tory electors

who recorded their votes for
them at the last election. They
might never be returned to the
House of Commons again.” This
reminds one of the men who, as
Macaulay said, take a ‘deliberate’ view of the state of the
country; they satisfy themselves
as to the leaning of the public
mind—and they choose their
side. But one must not accept
such a statement without question. Mr. Lloyd George has
never had much of a reputation
as a compromiser or as one to
whom extreme views are objectionable. It is true that the
Government steadily outrages
one Liberal principle after another. So called ties of honor,
or at least. what are supposed
to be such is the more likely
explanation for the continued
adhesion of what should be a
free, progressive force, to the
Conservative party.

A Communist Compromise.
Malthus, in his Essay on

Populaiion used to speak ironically of the professed economists’

who could believe that it was
“in the power of the justices of
the peace or even of the omnipotence of parliament to alter
by a fiai the whole circumstances
of the country.” The plan
which the President of the Council of the People’s Commissars
in Russia announced regarding
a fundamental change in the
Soviet agricultural economy for
the first year of the second Fiveyear Plan, shows that they have
realized the justification for the
irony. Ever since the first FiveYear Plan was started there has

been a continual clash between,

the peasant’s individualistic instincts and the attempt to force
him to yield up his grain to
the State when the force applied
Was excessive, as it often appeared to be to the ignorant peasant,
not versed in the subtleties of
Communist theory, he simply
stopped raising more grain than
was necessary for his own needs.
He had no incentive to great
effort. Why waste his labour in
raising a surplus quantity of
grain, when the only result was
that the produce was immediately seized by the collectors? This
system is to be replaced by a
fixed tax in kind, and the produce
remaining after this tax is paid
is to be left at the producer’s
disposition, thus providing him
with incentive to increase his
productivity.

Century Ago.”

“Ha there! The Freshies who
engage in window flirtations
must stop it at once, or we must
put names down.”

“Women are women, and it
would be decidedly unwomanly
to walk or drive to the polls and
drop into the ballot box a piece
of paper. They are entirely
too delicate and tender for such
tremendously trying work, it
would rob them of all their
sweet, dignified, retiring modesty. Such lovely, precious
bunches of humanity exist only
to be petted, caressed, protected,
loved and ever guarded by a
manly form from every care
and trouble in life. Being man’s
helpmate and equal is an amusing absurdity. A woman’s chief
aim in life should be to marry
and ever after attend to cooking
and household matters. The
question of voting should never
enter her mind. A woman is
not a person, not legally; she is
an inferior creature. The brain
of woman proves her inferiority.
Woman has no reasoning powers,
her’s are intuition, not judgment.
Can you imagine the effect of
such a living creature having a
vote and regulating the laws of
our country? And have we not
the authority of Paul when he
says women should be silent in
church?”

‘Probably the largest literary
prize ever offered is that of
$1,000,000 to be given in 1925
by the Russian Academy for the
best work on the life and reign
of Alexander I. In 1825, shortly
after the death of Alexander I,
the sum of 50,000 rubles was
offered by one of his favourite
ministers, to be given as a prize
a century after his death, and
this at compound interest will

amount to $1,000,000.”

“A young man asked” the
lady of his affections how she
liked his standing collar. ‘‘Very
nice indeed,” she replied, after
looking at him and the collar

for some time, ‘‘It looks like a
white-washed fence around a
lunatic asylum.”

‘There is a project on foot to

wine and dine the graduating
classes.”

“Our sanctum was invaded by
the infuriated victims of last
issue. We were unarmed. Since
then, however, we have pur
chased the following offensive
and defensive weapons:—A
crooked barrelled gun to shoot
around the corners; A Nordenfeldt to bring down the Freshmen multitudinous.’’ (And now
fifty years later, for the selfsame reason the Ga zette staff
have bought a sawed-off shot
gun and a splendid machine
gun.—Hd. Note),

‘It is currently reported t

Dalhousie College is to suffer the
loss of one of the ablest and
most active of her teaching
staff.”

 

 

“The latest is a letter ad
dressed to Miss Eugene Co,—

‘You should be a woman, Eugene

and yet your mustache forbids

us to interpret that you are so.”

 

 

“We regret that so few of our

students are inclined to give
any active support to the Gazette in the way of contributing

to its columns. A college paper,

in order to attain any degree of
success, should be warmly supported by the students whose
interests it professes to advocate.”

Mandelstan and Stoddard teamed up to score three baskets but
the Reds at last made the score
19-19. The return of Fairstein,

for a drive that netted the Tigers
five baskets making the score
29-22 with four minutes to go.
The shooting of Crease and’ the
combination of Fairstein and
