full holiday on March 14th in
order that the name of one of
the greatest benefactors of Dalhousie be fittingly honoured.

The Council of the Students have

say that they cannot do it again.
This will be followed by a keen
contest in which the younglings

for all that they can trounce the
veterans of Forrest. Many doubt
that this can be done. The

Council Censured

At Sodales

The attendance at Sodales
was somewhat larger than usual
last Tuesday evening, when the
subject before the House was:
‘Resolved, that the present system of Student Government is
satisfactory.”

Messrs. Miller and Rosenblum
upheld. the resolution, claiming
that the membership of the
Council was a representative as
it could be made; they also
pointed out the advantage in
having a permanent Secretary
Treasurer, and the elimination
of waste since his installation.
Messrs. Oxley and Lawrence attacked this point of view; they
contended that there should be
more members from the professional schools, that most students
did not want their Student Council fee spent on the promotion
of ping-pong and kindred sports,
and that the hotel dance question
had proven the inability of the
Council to meet a situation. All
four speakers were extremely
witty, often unconsciously so,
and the House was kept in an
uproar.

Following the debate there
were several speeches from the
floor. Among those who voiced
their opinions were Miss Jost,
the only member of the Council
present, the Misses Vernon,
March and Atherton, and Messrs
Dubinsky, Egan, Greene, Harris,
Kaningsberg and Redmond.

Before the meeting adjourned
the following resolution was passed. Resolved, that Sodales Debating Society places itself on
record as disapproving of the
action of the Students’ Council
in permitting a Boxing and
Wrestling Tournament to be
held on the same night that
Sedales was holding a debate
which was of fundamental importance to the whole student
body.

HALIBURTON CLUB.

A must enjoyable meeting of

the Haliburton Club was held in
the Haliburton Room of King’s
College, Saturday, March 4th.
The meeting was very well attended and the varied speeches
were heard with great interest.

Dr. A. A. Moore spoke on how to
speak in public. Other papers,
on Turkey’s part in the Great
War, the Amherst mystery, Depression—a wayout, and a caricature, were given by CarrHarris, R. Sweatnam, W. Hart
and C. Tanton respectively.
After the usual toasts were
honoured and the appropriate
songs sung, the pleasant meeting
broke up.

 

JUNIOR-SENIOR DANCE.

The Junior-Senior Dance, the
second one to be held in the New
Gym. promises to be an even
greater success than usual. We
have not heard that there will
any more “Human Fly”
stunts. Kit Haggerty’s Orchestra has been engaged so the
music will undoubtedly be good.

Tigers Win First
Play-off Round

Led by the sensational shooting of Bauld and Crease the
Tigers won the first game last
night by a score of 38-32. The
Wanderers played a different
style than usual, but the Tigers
thrusts were not to be denied and
the Collegians carry a 6 point
lead into Wednesdays game at
the Y.

The Wanderers started their
usual lineup while the Tige
had O’Brien replacing Anderson.
For a few minutes there was no
score, then the score read 1-1
until Piers made it 5-1, finally
the Tigers clicked and baskets
by Bauld (6), Crease (4) with
several penalties brought their
score to 22 while Piers and
Woodworth kept the Tigers in
the game by bringing their score
to 18 as the period ended.

In the second period Young replaced Grant as Wanderers center, but the Reds were unable to
score more than six points to
bring their score to 19 as the
Tigers made the score read 29-19.
For a few moments both teams
speeded up play to bring the
score to 35-26. At this period
the Tigers lost Bauld through
penalties and the Reds decided
to score. While they did succeed
in bringing their score to 32 the

MUNRO DAY.

 
 

 

~ A very fine program has been arranged to celebrate Munro
_ Day this year. This is the first time that such a venture has been
i undertaken and its success will depend on the students themselves.
-—__- One of the fundamental troubles with Dalhousie is that there is an
almost complete lack of fellowship among the whole student body.
This is partly explainable by the fact that we have no common
- room, no men’s residence, in short we have very few facilities which
joe ‘promote that fellowship between the whole student body so vital
to the success of student activities. Munro Day this year offers
oe a etGilents a chance to meet one another and in this way promote
~ a renewed interest in campus activities.. It is up to the students
to come and make the Munro celebration a real Dalhousie Day.
hose taking part in the activities are reminded that unless

i

e schedule of events is adhered to and each item run off on time

considerable difficulty will result.

THE LOSS SHIELDS.

On the north wall of the reading room in the Macdonald
Memorial Library hang several shields that have been offered on
---—- various occasions for inter-class or inter-faculty competition.
- When competition for these shields was inaugurated it was evidently intended that the names of the winning organizations should be
inscribed upon small shield-shaped plates to be attached to the
_ proper shields. This was done for a few years; but, due to the

negligence of the societies that should have had charge of them, the
trophies have been untouched (and unpolished) for a long time.
_-~_—s- The Pineo Shield for Interfaculty Rugby has four small plates
on it, the last of which states that Medicine triumphed in 1923.
As there is space for at least ten more plates, the shield should be
up for competition next autumn for the last time. How many
members of the present interfaclty rugby championship team knew
that they had won the Pineo Shield for 1932?
‘Most students have heard a good deal about the Bennett
Shield interclass debates. But the names of the winners of the
Shield Have not been inscribed since a prominent member of this
year’s graduating class in Law led the Sophmores to victory in 1929.
-_- In 1923 the Glee Club presented a shield for annual competition
to be awarded to the organized group of members presenting the
vest program. The last plate on this shield tells us that Delta
xamma presented the best show in 1926-27. There is space for
af _ two more plates on this shield.
ec ie We suggest that, in justice to the students and alumni whose
names should appear on these shields and in order to give to visitors

an impression that Dalhousie is really a wide-awake college, the
Dalhousie Amateur Athletic Club, Sodales and the Glee Club
consult their records or the files of the Cazelte and have the proper

inscriptions to the shields. If the Glee Club Shield was not award
: a ed in the years 1927-28 and 1928-29, we suggest to the new Glee

With thirty states having

the largest bank in the world
resigning under pressure, the
American banks are passing thru
one of the most chaotic periods
of their history. Because of
the Federal Reserve system and
the work of the R. F. C., likelihood of panics or runs is eliminated, yet steps must be taken
immediately to rectify the defects of the present banking
system brought to light by the
depression. During the last few
years, the larger banks sought to
branch out in their activities, to
increase their revenues, and to
get an enormous amount of
power. The result was that

dishonesty has now come to

branch banking; the bill to permit it recently failed to pass
Congress; whether or not Congress will pass it under Roosevelt remains to be seen, but
bankers. declare it to be the
solution of the problem, and the
problem must be solved.

Martial Germany.

Rapidly moving events in Germany are centering the interest
and apprehension of the world on
Hitler, dynamic and militant
leader of the Nazis. Anti-Semitic, imperialistic, and militaristic,
by forceful oratory based on a
platform of popular appeals, he
has gained a following large
enough to sweep him into the
dictatorship. This week, follow
ing the burning of the Parliament buildings, he announced
a rigid censorship of the Press
and the mails, suppression of al
Communistic activities, and virtually snapped his fingers at the
approaching elections. Whether or not President von Hindenburg would give way to a dictatorship under Hitler is not
known; what is known is that
he is an ardent monarchist, and
that if Hitler were in power he
would do everything possible
to restore the Hohenzollerns.
France, Russia, and England are
anxiously watching the progress
of the Nazi, for his success will
mean severance of relations with
Russia, revocation of the Treaty
of Versailles, and what is most
significant, the re-arming of Germany. Germany needs a strong
leader, a dictator, and her needs
may be fulfilled.

ot

Japan and Embargoes:

The placing of an embargo by
Great Britain on munitions for
Japan was a gesture made in the
expectation that other Powers
would follow suit. If they do
not, we can expect to see the
embargo lifted. The war in the
Orient is too fertile a field for
munition manufacturers for
them to refuse orders, and before
any country passes an embargo
act, a great deal of pressure will
be brought to bear by the Western war lords. Yet perhaps a
greater hindrance than an embargo to Japan is the fact that
her credit is none too good.
Her bonds have been steadily
declining in value, and any
munition manufacturer will

‘think carefully before accepting

any large orders, and he will
want a guarantee of payment,
which it is doubtful if Japan can
give. Lack of credit has halted
more than one war.

The Oxford Union decided, the

serieux let it be some consolation
that the Union is in no sense
representative of the University,
that (despite the eminent persons in every generation who
have used it as a training-ground
for Parliament) it has always
been liable to fall into the hands
of a little clique of cranks, and
that the great body of undergraduates live their life at Oxford without ever concerning
themselves about its activities.”

From which it would appear
that there are ‘apathetic’ students at Oxford, who treat the
Union the way Dalhousians treat
Sodales.

“This of the Craydon races,
too, if we read old Osborne with
reflection, will become significant
of many things. How the races
were going on, a delightful new
invention of that age; and Croydon Heath was populous with
multitudes come to see; and
between James Ramsay of the
Dalhousie Ramsays, and Philip
Herbert of the Montgomery Herberts, there rose sudden strife;
sharp passages of wit—ending
in a sharp stroke of Ramsay’s
switch over the crown and face
of my Lord Montgomery, the
great Earl of Pembroke’s brother, and himself capable to be
Earl of Pembroke....Can the
reader sufficiently admire it?
The honourable Philip Herbert
of the best blood of England,
here is he switched over the
head by an accursed Scotch
Ramsay. We hear the swiftstinging descent of the ignominious horseswitch; we see the
swilt-blazing countenances of
gods and men.”’

JIGG-SAW PUZZLES.

The jigg-saw puzzle craze, logical successor to the Mah Jong,
Tom Thumb Golf fads and the
cross-word puzzle fever, has begun to disrupt the placidity of
the college campus.

The students of Columbia
University are suffering from
a jig-saw puzzle complex.
‘“Meals are being eaten hurriedly
and much sleep is being lost so
that a two hundred and twentytwo piece “Barnyard” scene may
be completed.’’ The dormitories are cluttered with the weekly
puzzles: Jig-saw fans who have
completed their masterpieces and
are loath to have them disturbed
are protected by a rule which
says, “chambermaids are forbidden to so much as jiggle a
finished puzzle.”’

Jig-saw puzzling, although it
has not as yet been recognized as
the major indoor sport at Dalhousie, is quickly gaining popularity among those who have
fallen victims to the brain-twisting, bedazzling pastime. The
choice of subjects to be worked
out is astonishing. Whoever selected them must have been a
‘man of the world.” The subjects vary from the stirring scene
of “His Last Cartridge’ to the
milk and honey softness of a
touching pastel shaded word
called ‘‘The Proposal.”’ On
quizzing a few puzzle hounds
on the Dal campus, it was revealed that the puzzles with
human figures are the easiest to
work while a subject such as
“The Fisherman’s Torment’”’
with shady trees, fleecy clouds
and dashing waves, takes the
longest to piece together.

COLUMBIA CLEARED

In the Christmas issue of the
Dal Gazette attention was drawn
to athletic conditions at Columbia. Through the efforts of
the college paper a committee
of five had been appointed to
investigate charges of professionalism made by the Spectator. This committee now not
only clears the school system of
all suspicion but advises greater
facilities for athletic participation.

Chapter 13.

1. And the people arose in
a mass and shouted, give us a
show. Lo, have we not waited
many moons for a show since
they of the Noomin followers
presented a play unto us? -And
there was rumbling in the kolumz of the Gazziett, yea verily
the ruler there, Harryeld of the
tribe of Comm took up the plea
of the people and repeated, show,
show, give us a scho, oh Son of
Mur-Ray. 7

2. Then came in convoction
the Duhygg and the newcomer
Wyhittz and there began a
mighty preparation in the Muhneroe room and there was singing
and dancing and shouting even
unto the Libe of the men of Law,
yea verily in the domain of
Makkavoy who preacheth the
gospel of the fee simple and fee
absolute.

3. Then a certain day there
came Bobhee and the Minstrels
of the land to the amphitheatre
in the geem and lo, a mighty
production was given ‘unto the
people and there were sounds of
Brethren can ye spare a Dyhem
and Boddyenzole by the female
Krandyeall and she that is called
Minhee the Mootcher, yea verily
and the people were greatly pleased, and praise was offered up to
the men and women of the minstrels.

4. Behold it wasagret show
and the Kolumz of the Gazziett
will complain no longer.

5. Once again the battle cry
of the Council of Studes is heard
in the land. Again the people
are harangued and it is said
unto them, put me in power and
verily I shall do this and that;
yea I shall deliberate wisely and
there shall be no more extravaContinued on page 3.

 

In an exhaustive report the
committee found no evidence
of favoritism towards athletics
either as candidates for admission or the awarding of honors.
They were convinced however
that the association formerly
made direct efforts to secure
football players, but that this
practice was discontinued 18
months ago when control was
placed under direct University
supervision. Thus Columbia’s
athletics are no longer hidden
under the cloak of. suspicion.

University will formally receive
the first instalment of the Fund
for the ““‘Hugh Graeme Fraser
Memorial Award in Advanced
Chemistry” during Munro Day
ceremonies next week. ‘The presentatioon will be made by R.
Gordon Harris, B. Sc., of Halifax, Life Secretary of Class 1931,
which Class is presenting the
Memorial as its graduation gift.
Many students will recall how
this brilliant Dalhousian’s tragic
passing shocked the University
in February, 1931, merely three
months before his graduation in
Science, with Honours in Chemstry. A victim of nitrobenzine,
he failed to survive severe burns
received in the Organic Chemistry Laboratory. One of the

THE LATE HUGH GRAEME FRASER most brilliant and highly esteem
ed students in recent years, on

The spectacle of the stronger|the very threshold of noble young manhood, the fitting crown of
sex arrayed in pale pink shirts|his academic career was snatched from his brow, by the cruel hand
with ties to match still horrifies}of what men call an untimely death. His passing cast a deep
the more aesthetic among us;}shadow over the entire University; many were the high tributes

paid his memory, and at Pine Hill where he had resided for four

years, the shock was felt immeasurably.

F r he was not merely

a scholar, full of ambition, ability, and great promise,—he was
likewise a gentleman of the highest type and a true friend of his

associates.
no more.

It was well nigh unbelievable that we should see him

By unanimous vote of his Class, on the eve of graduation, the

‘Hugh Graeme Fraser Memorial

Award in Advanced Chemistry”’

was decided upon as the most fitting graduation gift, realizing that
none could be of greater significance to succeeding student bodies.
Formal announcement was made a year ago that Class '31 would

perpetuate the memory of their classmate in this manner.

Collec
tion of the Memorial Fund has been to date somewhat of an arduous
task, due to the fact that many class members have continued
University work in professional faculties; but the response has been
fairly gratifying, taking all into consideration; and the next few
years will, it is expected, continue to provide encouragement.

The first instalment, to be handed over next week, is five

hundred dollars.

This will be invested as the University sees fit,

with the approval of the Class Life Officers. The prize is one of

very few of its kind at Dalhousie.

It will be awarded annually by

a committee consisting of all professors and instructors in the
Chemistry Department, to a student completing his or her year
previous to the final one, to be tenable in the graduation year.
Conditions of award are posted in the Department at present;
and the first award will be made this Spring to some student who
intends to return next Fall ns a senior to continue Advanced Work

in Chemistry.

 

They'll probably boast to their
grandchildren that they never
missed a Delta Gamma Dance—
and as an afterthought, we wonder if the President of the AntiFeminist League was there; it
would be just like him

She met a man she thought she

He took her to a dance;

He spent the night in guzzling
gin ;

Each time he got the chance.

And e’re the festive evening

said, Behold it is not so and the

just a little difficult to decide.

 

But one thing is clear in my mind and
that is—it is not a fair proposition to

to work for t he benefit of others.

And I think all fair minded persons
will agree the Glee Club is endeavoring
to do its part for the benefit of Dalhousie.

readily understand how a person could
start a sentence—"‘It’s a crime’”’.....,
and then stop, as to say more might
start a war or something,

If | were talking about clothes, then
I wouldn’t need to hesitate, I could
very well say—‘‘It’s a crime to think

team will be:

Arab, flyweight and Bantamweight classes.

Fauldinger, lightweight class.

Glorioso, welterweight class.

Archibald, middleweight class.

D. Murray, “Big Jim’? McDonald, heavy and light-heavyweight classes.

With the exception of Fauldinger the team are all experiencedin Intercollegiate mitt-slinging.
With the strongest team since
1929 Dals chances of winning
the Phinney Shield are excellent.
The team have been working
out daily under Nedder Healy
and Jack McDonald and the
result is a quietly confident team
of Boxers. With the news that
there will be Tech., Dal., U. N.
B., and St. F.X. in the fight
Monday night interest in the
bouts has been shown by many
people, both collegians and
townies. All that is necessary
for success is a crowd of Dal
supporters and the Tiger mittslingers will have the Phinney

_. Karl Marx

—_——_

Past experience ought to have
taught us that excommunication
is by no means a universal silencer. March 14th will be the
fiftieth anniversary of the death
of Karl Marx and those fifty
years have emphasized our failure
to appreciate a truth which the
life of Luther illustrated. Since
his death the doctrines of Marx
have been continually held up to
ridicule The refutation of his
principles are part of the stockin-trade of every academic professor. Its defects, its miscontruing of the philosophy of history, its economic materialism,
the fallacious labour theory of
value, the undervaluization of
the profit motive, have been
shown dad nauseam. “It is one
thing,’ said Leslie Stephen, “‘to
recognize the existence of facts
which your theory will not explain, and to admit that it therefore requires modification. It is
quite another thing to explain
each set of facts in turn by
theories which contradict each
other.’’ We are ever ready to
point out the contradictions in
the Communist theory. Are we
equally willing to admit the
necessity of modification in our

own? And if so, what has the
philosophy of Karl Marx to
teach us?

In the first place, it is well to
point out that a theory which
has appealed to so many, which
has seemed plausible to many
profound thinkers must have
underlying it a substratum of
truth. Secondly, regardless of
its truth or falsehood, the discovery of what it is in Communism that makes it appeal to so
many of our time should make
the necessity of change and modification within the Capitalistic
system obvious.

The substratum of truth which

fourth straight in the City league | underlies the Communist theory
gave Dalhousie undisputed and|is to be found in the strong in
final possession of first place and
marked the first time that Dalhousie has won the intermediate
honours since the league was
formed.

The game started very slowly
with both teams playing a strongdefensive game and St. John’s
having a slight edge. However
with less than a minute to go in
the first half and St. John’s
leading 12-9, Ted Crease scored
on two very pretty shots to give
Dal a 18-12 lead as the first half
ended.

In the second half, with Don
McRae, former senior star, playing in great form, the Dal scoring
machine rolled in five baskets
without a return. This gave
Dal a 11 point lead with only 12
minutes to go and while St.
John’s fought gamely the big
floor was too much for them and
the best they could do was to
play Dal even the rest of the
game. It would be hard to
pick any outstanding men on
the Dal team as Crease, Sullivan,
McDonald, McRae, Clarke and
Dubilier all played great game.

 

Dal Co-eds Defeat
Mt. Allison

The Dalhousie Co-eds gained
their first intercollegiate victory
in over three years when they defeated the Mount Allison girls
24-15 at the new Studley gymnasium last Saturday.

The game opened with the Dal
Co-eds going full speed and it
wasn’t long before Flo Keniston
dropped in the first basket. The
Dal girls continued to push the
play and to control the ball and
consequently the end of the first
half found them leading 13-2.
In the second half the drive of
the first period was gone, but the
girls still had enough energy to
keep their lead secure and Mount
A. never were very dangerous.

For Dalhousie Flo and Martha
Keniston, Elizabeth Saunderson,
Mary Simmonds, Ethel Jackson
and Margaret Woolaver played
very well, while Gwen Morehouse
stood out for Mount Allison.

 
 
    
  
 
 
 
 
   
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
  
  
 

Stuart Mill looked forward to a

either be, or be thought to be,

dictment that is brought against
the present social order. The
conquests of scientific discovery
far exceeded our ability to adjust
our social environment to them.
Consequently, at present neither
our methods of production, nor
our principles of distribution are
capable of explanation in terms
of social justice. When the gain
of living is denied to the majority
of those who toil, is it any wonder
that a theory which commits
such an error as to assume that
whit is true of those who have
only muscular power to sell
must be true of the great mass
of the people, gains a universal
appeal? The appeal of a theory
whch promises an equal share
in the gain of living as well as in
its toil, to those for whom future
benefits seem exceedingly remote
is not difficult to explain or to
justify, and this is just what
Capitalism at present does not do.
The sorry plight in which we
find ourselves is shown by the
fact that a theory which does
this is one which offers us the
formulae of conflict as a method
for working out our salvation.
But its strength lies not its practicability, which it does not
possess, but in its ideal, which
resembles more than anything
else a religious faith.

The recognition of this last
points also to what is lacking in
the Capitalistic system. That

practice from religious and moral
faith, has not proven itself successful enough to do. without
these things. Moreover, having
in the past dispensed with those
aspects which invoke allegiance
and compel alliance, it has fostered such a rigidity in itself that
such things seem to have no porthole from which to enter. What
Capitalism needs is an infiltration into it of many of those
things that give Communism
its appeal, above all, a willingnes
to lower the rights of property
from its pedestal as a dread
Absolute, and a closer approximation of our economic practice
to our moral and religious faith.

In the middle of last century,

the great merit of Karl Marx to
have emphasized its desirability,

or not, the vital necessity for the
incorporation of its spirit in any

Exhibition Game
Lost To Acadia

Dalhousie lost the most exciting exhibition game of basketball ever staged in the new Dal
gymnasium to Acadia last Thursday night 50-48. The finishes of
the regular game and the first
overtime period had the spectators hanging over their chairs.
With less than a minute to go
and Dal three points behind,
Bauld was fouled in the act of
shooting and was awarded two
free shots. Acadia was slow in
sending in a substitute and Dal
was given an extra shot for the
breach of a technicality. Bauld
shot the whole three and how he
shot them. -As cool as_ the
proverbial cucumber he dropped
them in without touching the
rim to tie the score at 36 all.
In the first overtime Dal gained
a three point lead, but Cameron
shot a foul shot and a long one
to tie up and send the game into
the second overtime period at
A4lall. Acadia walked away with
the game then as the Dal. defense
cracked from the strain.

The game itself did not produce very good basketball.
Bauld and Fairstein were not
working as well as usual and the
Dal. combination plays did not
lead to scores. Acadia played a
slow game relying mainly on long
shots. This type of game however proved very effective as
Cameron and Goudey dropped
them in from everywhere to
score 34 of their team’s 50 points.
Acadia led at half time 20-16 and
the only reason, the lead wasn’t
larger was the fact that the Dal.
guards Musgrave and Anderson
were playing a stong steady
game and scoring equally with
the forwards.
