that the Council vote is much

they are. This will only be possibleif Nomination Day proceedings are prompt.

the election a week later. It is hard to

Dalhousie
_Leads Again

‘Dalhousie leads in all roads” were the
concluding words of the editorial in a
recent issue of the Gazette. An excellent illustration of this is shown by
some recent happenings at a local college,
—the Nova Scotia Tech. The midterm exams were held there some weeks
ago, and when the pass list appeared,
with the top man first and the remainder
alphabetically, it was found that over
seventy-five per cent of the leaders in all
classes were ex-Dalhousie Engineers—
truly a significant fact considering that
only one third of the total enrolment are
former Dalhousians. Still another ‘‘road’
in which our Engineers at Scotia Tech.

 

 

_ are foremost is the management and

decorating of Tech. dances. “At the
1927 dance the major decorating scheme,
certainly the best at an N. S. T. C. Ball
for many years, was the work of Remi
niot, Engineers of ’25.

Many of the smaller decoration schemes
were the work of Dal boys also, Altogether from a Dalhousie standpoint it
was quite a triumph.
Medicine may be Grade ‘‘A”; Law ma
be one of the best in America, but Dalhousie Engineers are not to be despised.

another expression of the high-tide of
enthusiasm and success which is sweeping
the college. Itis partly also that students,
to the credit of recent Councils, are
beginning to realize the importance of the
Council, which controls every university
activity. There was a time when a
seat on the Council was regarded merely
as an honour—the election was a popularity contest. That time is gone:
students now know that there is a duty
on every member of the Council to show
an active interest in the affairs of the
university and to devote energy and
thought to advancing student interests.
Those are the reasons why the approaching elections are going to be an intelligence
test instead of a popularity contest.

The interest shown makes it safe to
predict for March 1 a record vote. Usually
the vote, particularly in a large polling
division like Arts, is smaller than one
would expect. This is due partly to the
fact that very few voters know all the
candidates: generally when a voter does
not know the candidates he wisely
refrains from voting. Publication of the
candidates’ names will obviate this
difficulty, which never occurs in a municipal, provincial, or federal election,
but is due to the modesty of our candidates. Students will make it their
business to find out what those names
stand for—what the candidates are and
what are their al.lities. That will be
easy.

Delta Gamma

Visits H. L. C.

NE of the most important and
enjoyable meetings of Delta Gam
ma was held at the Halifax Ladies
College last Saturday evening. There
was an unusually large attendance,

including a great many old H. L. C. girls
who were delighted to be back in the
old school and under Miss Blackwood’s
wing again, even if only for a few hours.

The short business meeting was held
in the drawing-room before a blazing
fire. The business brought before the
meeting included a discussion of the
Delta Gamma dance, and the Glee Club
Show. It was also decided to contribute
$10 to the Year Book. After a brief
discussion of ways and means, the
meeting adjourned.

The big event of the evening, the
debaté between Dalhousie and H. L. C.
took place in the dining-room, which was
cleverly decorated with the colours of
both colleges. The resolution was as
follows: ‘‘Resolved that the course leading
to the diploma of Licentiate of Household
Science is of more value to a woman
student than that leading to the degree
of Bachelor of Arts.’’. The affirmative
was upheld by Muriel Love, Mary
Stanford and Truth Fairn for H. L. C.
cand the negative by Margaret Ells,
Jessie Gladwin and Sheila Macdonald
for Dalhousie. Miss Jean Forrest was
in the chair. The speakers were allowed
l ten minutes each with three minutes for
rebuttal by the leader of the affirmative.

Muriel Love opened the debate with a
most convincing speech, very obviously
intending to give no quarter to the enemy.
She pointed out how the _ household
Science course included many of the
cultural subjects of the Arts course and
had the added advantage of being a
sound practical training as well. She
also comforted the audience with the
assurance that if they were doomed to
suffer the ‘awful fate of marriage,
they were at least well prepared if they
had studied household science. ‘‘The
way to man’s heart is through his stom

and other fields.”’

Players Wanted For
Convocation Ploy

Professor Pierce will meet those girls
who wish to try a part in the Convocation
Play on Thursday afternoon at Shirreff
Hall at 3.30. We hope to meet;

Grace:—An ordinary loveable girl—
rather a difficult part.

 

Mrs. Barstow:—None too ladylike,
former actress.

Mrs. Livingston:—Mother—stout preferred.

Hattie:—A little colored maid.

 

Favoritism plays no part in the
selection of a caste for the Convocation
Play, nevertheless it is quite impossible
to extend a personal invitation to every
girl, and since selection will be entirely
on a competitive basis, and since we are
anxious to get the best, the larger the
field the better.

Monday night, quite a large number of
men tried parts, and had a good lark in
the bargain, it being a case of survival
of the fittest. Men who did not have an
opportunity to try Monday night and
any others interested, meet Professor
Pierce at the Gym at 5 p.m. Thursday.
As yet no suitable middle-aged doctor has
appeared. Those to whom these hours
are not convenient call John Shaw

peak as ever in the history of Dalhousie.
Those persons who are never happy
unless bewailing its absence might as
well pack up and find another university.
It is only necessary to look at the achievements of the present year to realize
that there is some force at work in the
university—a feeling of unity and optimism which is College Spirit. In _ reviewing the successes of the first half of
the year the Gazette announced that the
various executives were planning for their
organizations whirlwind finishes. A
stock-taking shows that they were not
lavish in their promises. Athletics, in the
face of many difficulties, prospers. Glee

entertainment. Sodales has been weekly
the forum of spirited discussions. The
various faculty societies are busy: the
Meds have just put on a big banquet, the
Lawyers are staging their annual Mock
Parliament, the Engineers are always
doing something, the Commerce Society
is putting on a series of meetings. The
Council is completing a year of sound
financial administration.
Now comes the Year Book. The way
in which the Year Book is taking hold

is all that anyone could desire. The
Business Manager is calling in the
subscription lists this week—he has

already sold all the Year Books. It is
things like the Year Book and Theatre
Night that are marking out this year.
How have things changed so? Whence
came this College Spirit? It has come
through the realization that the fault
lay in ourselves, that Lack-of-CollegeSpirit was only our own inactivity, that
we were not giving ourselves a chance.
The lack of a residence is nothing beside inactivity; a residence will not

In fact it was so interesting that the

therefore been decided to continue the

There will be no speakers especially

The result of the debate was a vote of
19—8 in favor of Secession. According
to the Halifax Herald ‘‘This news will be

Dalhousie’s name will be coupled ‘with

endeavour and activity—activity begets
activity.

It is only necessary to look at the records of undergraduate life in former
years to see that the enthusiasm of
today has never been equalled. The
Gazette files have few stories of enthusiasm and accomplishment; editorial after
editorial, telling the same tale, bewails
a lack of college spirit. Nor is it necessary
to hark back so far—-many at. Dalhousie
today can tell what the college was like
when there was no Glee Club and no
Sodales. Dalhousie has learned her lesson
—there is no such thing as a lack of college

outlets.

Your Biggest
Opportunity

What with Joe Mills’ re-inforced
orchestra, beautiful home-like hangings,
specialty refreshments, congenial chaperones, happy Seniors, and hospitable
Juniors, the Junior-Senior Dance this
year offers every opportunity for people
of every temperament to have a “humdinger”’ of a time.

The ‘‘Junior-Senior’’ is as old as the
College and has always been famous for
the spirit of joyfulness that seems to be
in the atmosphere. This year the committee is bending every effort and spending wisely and effectively to create the
atmosphere and environment necessary
for a dance that'll be called not only
successful—but a dance that'll set a
precedent for all future dances,

the
heading “Taking Stock in Nova Scotia.”

SODALES Debating Society of Dalhousie University
held a debate on Wednesday evening. The question
was the wisdom of Nova Scotia in entering Confeder
ee. ation. The vote of the audience taken after the

debate resulted in a win for secession by a score of 19 to 8.
In a previous debate at Dalhousie it was voted that a politician could not be successful without being a crook. 
Does this mean that secession finds favor with Dalhousie? This news will be wafted across Canada and by

- outsiders, Dalhousie’s name will be coupled with secession.

«Tf debates are to be held on subjects like those mentioned,

Str

then the University authorities cannot escape from responsibil
ity for such consequences that may ensue.

F We quote this firstly because in showing how grossly the author
understands a particular college activity we can best emphasize
he real significance of student activities in general. Secondly we
quote it because the spectacle of a superficial conclusion best brings
out by contrast the true student attitude to debatable questions.
Thirdly we quote it in order to answer the base insinuation levelled
against the Dalhousie authorities.
. ‘In regard to the first point, Sodales Debating Society like all other
major student institutions such as the Gazette, the Glee Club, and the
-D. A. A. C. stands absolutely independent of the University authorities. These societies receive their grants from the Students’ Council
which in turn gets every cent of its income from the students themselves. Their officers are elected by and their policies controlled by
the students themselves. It follows from this then that the sole
responsibility for any action by or utterance within a student group
falls on the students themselves. Therefore let it be understood that
while students, and student executives welcome criticism from any
-source whatsoever they always have the come—back: ‘‘This is our own
business.”
In the second place the author of the above extract seems to
think that the vote of the audience purported to settle once and for
all the secession question. He seems to reason this way. Since
Sodales voted secession 19—8, therefore Sodales has settled the question. Since Sodales is a society composed of Dalhousie students, therefore the Dalhousie authorities are committed to secession. Since the
Dalhousie authorities are members of an ancient, respected and degree
conferring institution, then, if they are committed to a policy, whether
in their sphere or not, it must be right, and by the fallacy “ad hominem’’ we must all agree. Could anything be more contrary to the
student’s attitude to debatable questions! We as students affirm
that a man need believe a thing only if the data of his own experience,
coupled with right reason proves conclusively to his own mind that it
is correct. This is the only test an individual need apply. Therefore if secession is to recommend itself to the people of Nova Scotia
it must do so because it is the product of ascertained facts together
with right reason, not because of the say so of any individual or of
any society—no—not because of the say so—of.as celebrated a
society as Sodales.
In the third our critic makes the following surprising statement
“Tf debates are to be held on subjects like those mentioned then the
Un versity authorities cannot escape from responsibility for such
consequences that may ensue.” If the University authorities cannot escape the responsibility, then the inference is that they exercise
a censorship on the expressions of the opinions of students. If this
were true “it were a grievous fault.” It would mean that Dalhousie
was still in the stage that Nova Scotia was in before Howe's great
battles for the freedom of the press. It would mean that it was the
consistent policy of the Dalhousie authorities to stifle self-expression
and intellectual activity. Such a policy is however, we are proud to
say, absolutely contrary to the traditions and policy of Dalhousie
f In fact Dalhousie has the enviable distinction of being
the first university in the British Empire to admit students, regardless
of race, sex or creed. The one requirement was then and is now

as ‘ a certain standard of scholarship. The authorities of Dalhousie ask

no questions as to a student’s attitude on either religious or political

- questions. They assume that British principles should prevail within
_ the campus as well as without—that “girted round by friends or foes

the man may speak the thing he will.” This is the stand that the
Dalhousie authorities take, and we as students are proud of it. It is

   

ah oi

DALHOUSIE GAZETTE,
A Haliburton Club?

OO great a proportion of the vol
uminous criticism levelled during
the present year against persons and
institutions has been destructive instead
of constructive. It is with this in mind
that I venture to offer a suggestion which
seems to lean rather in the other direction.
We have here at Dalhousie an overabundance of clubs and societies. Not
that the fault lies in the overabundance
any more than in the societies themselves,
but it does lie most emphatically in the
absence of a certain type of society.,
There are no clubs, for men at least
which combine in their meetings, to the
extent they should combine, easy goodfellowship and a purpose outside that of
ureenjoyment. Furthermore Dalhousie
has among its students a great number of
a retiring, and a still greater number of a
quiet, disposition. These men, while
they may attend the Glee Club entertaintments, want at least sometimes to
get away from music, acting, and dancing.
For them there is little distinction between Glee Club and any of the local
theatres. Their mental reaction to both
is identical. And the great reason for
this is that they themselves do not take
part—their interest is not personal.
The same thing can be said of Sodales.
It is not the least use to issue sweeping
invitations to such students telling them,
among other bunk, that they have a
duty to their college. They need a
little gentle probing, a little encouragement, and a little opportunity, before
they can prove their worth. And the
answer to these three requirements
must be patent to anybody who has
been so lucky as to attend a meeting of
the King’s Haliburton Club. Dalhousie
needs a counterpart to Haliburton.

The appeal of such a club would not
for a moment be limited to the quiet and
retiring student. Meeting regularly and
informally with an open invitation to
interested professors it would do more
than anything else to prevent student—
faculty unpleasantness. The Gazette a
short time ago contained a criticism of
Dalhousie for not entertaining Wilson
MacDonald. during his stay in the city.
The criticism, leaving aside any question
of Wilson MacDonald's personal merits,
was just in principle. It is safe to say
that after his visit to Haliburton MacDonald left Halifax with a far higher
concepticn of Kings than of Dalhousie.
And this will happen again, unless there is
some society who take it upon themselves to invite distinguished visitors to
their meetings. The club, besides fulfilling this duty, would afford an informal
speaking school for those who for various
reasons do not attend Sodales. And
then Dalhousie has glorious traditions—
just as glorious as those of Kings. Yet
hardly a Dalhousie student realizes what
great men have gone before him and
what great achievements he could emulate
if he wished. The club would foster
Dalhousie’s traditions. With all this,
but far more important than all this, it
would bind students more closely together than the present societies can
because of their very nature.

I feel then, even as a rabid Dalhousian,
that we in this one thing at least could
well emulate our neighbours and friendly
rivals at King’s. We could to our own
advantage form a society with its chief
interest in literature, and with~its model,
the Haliburton Club.

Miss Alice Davis
Protests.

EADERS will note at once the
absence from this issue of the
Mmoirs of a Young Man at College.
They will find the reason in the following

 

 

 

letter, which arrived just as we were
going to press. We held a hasty consultation and decided to withhold,

until we could see Miss Davis, this week’s
instalment. We thought it the least we
could do, to make amends to our readers,
to publish her letter—she will excuse us,
we know.

Sir: There has been appearing in your
columns, in weekly instalments, the
recollections and imaginings of a gentleman who names himself Mr. Jack Smith
and his writings the Memoirs of a Young
Man at College. Having exhausted, in
his first two articles, the possibilities
of his own family, he turns, from that
poverty, to the wealth of tradition which
surrounds the Davises. I object, Mr.
Editor. It is not because he did not
dump us into the pond, with bulrushes
and yellow cow-lilies, and three feet of
mud at the bottom; nor is it because my
hair is not red. We Davises have always
been a self-respecting family. If Mr.
Smith thinks his career momentous
enough to warrant his giving it to the
public, I ask—not that there are any
skeletons in the family closet—that he
do not disclose any part I may have had
in that comicdrama. I shrink, withallthe
modesty of my sex, from the publicity of
it. And then, it seems, he would, with
every mention, cast a slur on my name.
“The Davis girl fought as well as her
brother.” I protest, with all my weakness, that I have never been in a fight—

The story is told of an army veteran
who returned to the home of his childhood
to attend a banquet giveu by the old boys
of his school. He expected them to talk
of old times, but one talked incessantly

of his bad liver, another had a heart disease,
another had kidney trouble, and so on,

when the veteran returned home he was

asked how he enjoyed the banquet.
“Banquet,” he exclaimed, ‘‘it wasn’t
a banquet at all. It was an organ recital.”’

my life has been a path of unrelenting
virtue. ‘‘His sister was chewing gum.”
Oh, what a lie! What a lie! I have
never chewed gum—my own or auybody
else’s. I hope I never may. These are
only two of the slanders he has cast upon
me: before this letter reaches you even
others may appear. I object, Mr.
Editor, to these Memoirs. Were they to
appear in a paper of a lesser circulation
and my name were at al! times mentioned
with respect, I might abide them. As it
is, I cannot.

You will probably have wondered, ere
this, Mr. Editor, how Mr. Smith spent
the years, about which he is silent, previous to his arrival at the university. [|
can give you, if you are interested, some
light on that subject. What I am about
to relate, Mr. Smith can deny if he likes.
No single lie can add materially to the
everlasting disgrace he has brought to the
name Smith. There is little wonder,
unless it be why they did not choose
Newfoundland, that his family removed to
Cape Breton. Jack Smith spent the
intervening years—but perhaps I should
prepare you for the revelation | am about
to make. May I remind you that he is
of very doubtful descent, that his pedigree is not all that it should be. I
have heard that there were criminals in
thé family. I know, as a positive fact
that his father played Patience. He
himself has admitted, witha glibness that
does him little credit, that his mother
swore. I can save you little by holding
back longer what I have to reveal. Jack
Smith spent the years about which he is
so silent in the pursuit of knowledge—
studying.

I do not think that he, or his family,
can ever live it down. I have already
taken, Mr. Editor, too much of your
valuabletime. Wishing you every success
in the venture of publishing a great
newspaper, I am,

 

a stand which commands not only the respect of her rivals but the

honor of her Alumni.

It is a stand which she will not alter for any
reactionary reporter, more fitted to live in the days before Howe than

to practice, in this presumably enlightened age, the profession which
that great statesman did so much to ennoble.

THE LIFE OF A
LITTLE COLLEGE

The Year Book is now more than
“something talked of’. The first form
is ready for the printers, the advertising
is all secured, and the students are still
co-operating by sending in their copy
early and by completing groups and
returning proofs for the photographer.
The financial situation, also, is mos}
encouraging. The Year Book is certainly making progress—thanks to everyone.

 

 

* * *

Next week Mock Parliament opens with
all the pomp that has marked this event
for centuries. The gallery facilities are
excellent and those who attend will be
sure to hear some splendid speeches.
Col. W. E. Thompson is GovernorGeneral. His Excellency will read the
speech from the throne. The Right
Hon. J. F. MacManus and his government will then meet the house.

The Lawyers had another of their
famous luncheons last week. Mayor
Kenny addressed the Society on Civic
Government. The talk was more than a
discussion of mere political science.
His Worship gave a glimpse of the
personal side of “running the city.”’

Tomorrow night Dr. MacMechan will
give his long a waited talk on Nova Scotia
Ships and Sailor Folk. i

The men’s basketball team are making
a strong bid for the City Championship.
The team’s showing is a matter of pride
to every Dalhousian.

Speaking of sport you will find elsewhere in this issue a cordial invitation
to see the girls play Acadia on Saturday.
It is a good opportunity to show our old

An Impromptu Hunt

Ee every profession, the monotony of

the daily routine is broken by some
incident which actually has nothing to
do with the work. If it were not for
these happenings, a great many people
would often be at a loss for conversation,
particularly those whose occupations
are such, that they must fall back on
their own inventiveness for amusement
after working-hours. Engineers on construction fall into this class and one can
imagine the spice given to the evening
chat, when the following tale was told
by the men who took part in it.

Not long ago, there was a party on
track-repair work in the Rockies and as
s usually the case in this type of work,
the men were housed in a box-car. The
car had been shunted on to a siding,
which happened to be located at one
end a large fill. The far end of theof
fill gradually rose to a cut that fadde
out of sight into thick, heavy bush;
wonderful covering for all kinds of game.

The engineer in charge had gone out
that morning, taking his assistant with
him and leaving Bill and Charlie, the
two chainmen, and Angus, the cook,
in camp. As there was nothing much
to do, the three were spread around the
car, talking. Bill happened to wander
over to the door and glanced down the
fill. The next instant, he beckoned to
the other two to come over and take a
look as well.

_ Down one side of the dump was wadd
ling a large, fierce-looking bear, and,
judging by his protruding ribs, a decidedly
hungry one. Now a bear in that country
is always fair game, if one has any kind
of a weapon and plenty of sporting-blood.
The three in camp had both these things
and in spite of the fact that the weapon
was only a shot-gun and that the ammunition was only bird-shot, they decided
that some part of that beast must form
a side-dish for the dinner that night.
They almost came to blows over the
honour of using the gun, but finally
settled the matter by drawing lots;
Bill being the lucky man,

The bear was too far away from the
car for the gun to do any damage, so it
was decided that Bill would go along
the opposite side of the fill from the
animal; when he drew level with it
Charlie would whistle, Bill would jump
to the top of the embankment, fire, and
if he missed, Charlie and Angus would
come to his rescue with axes.

The plan was a mad, dangerous one’
but the three’ never even considered that

_ FIRST UP-TO-DATE BRIDGE
_ TOURNAMENT THIS WEEK

_-FFHIS week is by all manner of means

par. the most memorable, momentous,
_~ and marvellous for Dalhousie in the whole
a . Pes We've had our debates. We've
had our sports. We've had our exams.
_ We've had our scraps with the profs.

And yet there is not a student from
_ Herbie down to the greenest freshman who
__-will not admit that there is something
__we haven't had—some little thing that
has so far been missing in our young
____ lives, some little thing that we have been
yearning for, begging for with the cry
of our hungering hundreds, some little
thing to still forever our grumbling at
_ profs, at plucks, and at classes. And
students we’ve got that thing at last!
On this red letter week the Studley
3 Bridge Club begins its annual tourn
et ament!

We wonder how many of our serious
____ minded professors realize when they
are introducing our learning—yearning
minds to the mysteries of, “‘Milton in his
— Comic Poetry”, or “The Historical
ze Background of the 15th. Line of the 2nd
Ode, of the 1st Book of Horace”’ that down
- below, in the male smoking room, are a
small band of pioneers, labouring amidst
the overwhelming fumes of tobacco to
> fect some method of improving their
intolerable conditions. The Dalhousie
professors get altogether too much credit.
They lecture in well lighted rooms with
“all modern conveniences. These young
men are horribly restricted in their
praiseworthy work by imperfect im_ plements. The packs of cards are old,
_ dirty and torn, thumbed and dog-eared.
_ Cards are missing. An old class picture has even been requisitioned as a
card table. And yet they carry on their
___ research with one beautiful beacon always
- beckoning them on. They are ‘the
unsung heroes’ of our little college!
_ And at last they have given the world
Raat; the results of their labours; and Dalhousie
is on the threshold of better things—
We are having an up-to-date bridge
tournament!

A freshmen, bridge is a game played by

It comes to the Majestic on Monday,
Feb. 21, for an engagement of one week.
The cast is all-star and exceptional.
The chorus deserves a special note since
it is not a chorus at all. It is a solo
ballet with every girl in the group both a
beauty and an expert. To give one
reviewer's findings on this
“in most of the productions seen here,
each girl would find a place above the
chorus, Each dancer with the talent of
a soloist.”

As well as the beauties in the ballet,
there is in the cast, an internationally
famous Canadian beauty queen Jean
Ford Tolmie, who, as Miss Toronto,

beauty contest. She was rated by
artists and sculptors as one of the three

ach” was her _ scathing indictment
of the sterner sex. She also quoted
from a popular magazine to the effect
that marriages would be more _permanent if girls spent more time making
cages and less making snares. This
speech was not only entertaining but very
logical and well expressed.

Margaret Ells, the first speaker for the
negative showed her ability to think
quickly in her keen rebuttal. She pointed
out that it was all very well to be able to
cook and sew if one desired to be a cook
or a dressmaker, but that the girls who
studied for a B. A. had not such high
aspirations. She said that the average
girl in Arts can cook anyway and that she
learns the theory of housekeeping and the
composition of foods from her economics
and chemistry. ‘‘We,” she protested,
“are not responsible for the utterings of
the so-called popular magazines,” and
why learn to read a gas meter when the
company provides a man to do it for you?

Mary Stanford then spoke for the
affirmative. She was a most appealing
speaker, quiet, logical and to the point.
She stressed the financial advantages of
the course in Household Science. The
girls who have their diploma are ready for
good positions at once, whereas the B. A.
cannot even teach without further training. This innocent remark was the cause
of some heated arguments and Dalhousie
backed up her side with such shining
examples as K. Buttenshaw and Edith
MacNeill.

Jessie Gladwin followed Mary Stanford.
She turned out to be a real ‘‘find” with
something of Alice Atherton's fighting
spirit. She backed her arguments with
quotations from such noted authorities
as Dorothy Dix. Jessie pointed out that
while a mother might benefit her children’s
stomachs if she had a Diploma of Household Science, it was infinitely more
important to benefit their minds, that the

The whooping of the fog-horn,
Comes faintly down the gale
That is roaring from the ocean

_ Bringing sheets of driving hail.
The crashing of the breakers
When they burst in frothing foam,
Rouses souls to battle-snadness
In the glory of the storm.

The sting of lashing hailstones

And the swish of racing surf,

The thudding boom of rollers

That are pounding mother earth;
The shrieking wails of sea birds

That are swirling round the beach,
Touch the old, deep rooted instincts
Demanding action more than speech.

children were the coming thinkers and
would benefit greatly by having mothers
with educated tastes. This was one
of the wittiest speeches of the evening.
Truth Fairn then spoke for the Affirmative. She was very fluent and her
manner was exceptionally pleasing. She
stressed the opportunities for service, both
in the home and the community, that
are open to graduates in Household
Science. She also showed how valuable
such trained workers are in the social
problems that are so vital to-day.

The last speaker for the negative,
Sheila Macdonald, was rather brief, but
clear and concise. She pointed out the
advantage of a B. A. degree in applying
for any position and added that it was
becoming not only an advantage but a
necessity in many cases. She clinched
her arguments by remarking that a
B. A. was even necessary to a graduate
in Household Science, if she were to
obtain good positions, in fact that was
why she was taking her Arts course.

In her rebuttal Muriel Love emphasized the cultural and interesting side of
the course in Household Science and
informed her opponents that she did
occasionally think of something — besides
cooking and sewing, and that the girls in
Household Science were not as MidVictorian as the B. A’s seemed to think.

A standing vote was taken at the close
of the debate, which resulted almost
in a draw, being 44—43 in favour of
Dalhousie.

After the refreshments, which were
unusually delicious, the floor was cleared
for dancing, which continued until the
meeting broke up. The members of
Delta Gamma voted the evening one of
the best in their experience and were
united in expressing most sincere thanks
to Miss Blackwood for her hospitality.

Delta Gamma

At Glee Club

 

wie regard to a general meeting of
Delta Gamma, the men of the
University are in as complete a state of
blissful ignorance as could be well imagined. It is vaguely understood that at
the conclusion of the Mystic Ritual an
entertainment often takes place, but as to
this we may only speculate, since history
has no record that the ear hath heard,
nor the eye of man seen any such thing.
So it is with considerable enthusiasm
that we learn that at a recent meeting of
Delta Gamma a committee was appointed
to arrange an entertainment at Glee Club,
and to this end the following girls were
put in charge: Jessie Gladwin, Muriel
Donahoe, Freda Winfield, Aileen MacAuley, Margaret Smith, Avis Marshall,
Eveleen Burns,H arriet Matheson. Their
performance being still in a formative
stage, the convenor or any member of
this committee would no doubt welcome
a suggestion which any girl would make.

MEETING ADOPTS HONOUR SOC
IETY PROPOSAL

 

The Council has submitted to
the Senate, for its approval, an
important amendment to its constitution. The effect is that the
Council would consist of twelve
members—Arts eight, Medicine
two, Dentistry one, Law one. The
eight Arts members would be
distributed as follows: Senior and
Junior classes two each, Sophomores one, Commerce one, Engineering one, and a Freshman Representative; one of the Senators and
one of the Juniors to be women.
Should this proposal fail, there is
an alternative which would result
in a Council of about eighteen
members. The above step is the
result of a lengthy meeting, to
which the constitutional committee reported, held Tuesday afternoon.

At the same meeting the Council adopted, on the report of the
constitutional committee, instead
of the proposal to appoint an
Assistant, a proposal to appoint
the Gazette Business Manager
earlier than usual; this will give
an incoming man an opportunity
to get acquainted with the work,
before taking charge, and enable
him to help his predecessor. The
Council will appoint the Editor at
the same time. It is probable
that the Council will make these
appointments at its next meeting.
The meeting adopted the Honour
Society proposal society also. The
committee which will select the
members for this year consists of
Profs. Wilson and Gowanloch,
Miss Alice Atherton, Mr. Gerald
Godsoe and Mr. Ronald Hayes.

DALHOUSIE GAZETTE

 

! In the World of Sport

GIRLS TAKE GOOD GAME. SENIOR HOCKEY.

To readers of
The Dalhousie Gazette

 

 

The Hockey team returned to the
city on Saturday morning from Fredericton, where they en-erged on the short
end of a 5—0 score. The members of the
Dal team speak most highly of the U.N.
3. players and of the hospitality accorded
them while in New Brunswick.

N a fast, interesting game on Tues.

Feb. 8th, Dal girls defeated the ¥
Aces: It was the deciding game in one
section of the city league—a win meant
the Section for Dal, a loss meant a long
series of play-offs. The whole team
responded well and the dance the night
before seemed to have had no bad effects
on the Shirreffians, all of whom played a
remarkably good game. The guards
played. an exceptionally tight, hard
game and Miss Phinney outdid all her
records in the second period. Miss
Freeman was decidedly on her shot and
scored many rather lucky baskets at the
end of nice combination plays started by
her. The team was undoubtedly strengthened and encouraged by the return of
Miss Borden who is playing side centre
for the fourth season. She uses her head
and has all the marks of an experienced,
clever player; she and Miss Thompson
kept control of the ball at centre. This
time we had a few more supporters but
we want EVERYONE at the game with
Acadia in the Dal gym., this Saturday at
12 a.m.

The Intermediate Basketball team
after winning five straight games lost
tothe ‘‘Y” secondteam Friday evening
in a ragged game played in the “Y”’
gymnasium.

The Y-ites got away to a fast start and
maintained their lead throughout the
game.

This win practically gives the “‘Y’
the championship of the Intermediate
League as they have only one more game
to play.

Interfaculty league on Saturday afternoon. ‘The league-leading Arts B team
were taken into camp by the Commercialites 16—7 in the first game while the
