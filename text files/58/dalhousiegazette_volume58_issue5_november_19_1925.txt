Mr. Stewart, however, was seized with
a paroxysm of laughter over a joke he had
just told to Mr. J. E. Read, and was unable
to answer, so I turned to another section
of the room.

“Mr. Bean I would like to ask you a
sittle question in Ethics. What do you
think of a professor, who sits in his office
leaving the door to his laboratory ( in
which students are working) open, and
allows the fragrant odor of cigarette upon

I dismissed the subject.

fingers through his hair.

At this point I noticed that Mr. MacMechan was garbed in a high necked
sweater, which brought another question
to my ‘mind.

“A little problem in law, Mr. MacMechan. What legal right has a man
who never shaves, to criticise a fellow
mortal for wearing a sweater?”

Mr. MacMechan masticated his chewing

Punctuality

Keeping faith with an engagement may
seem to some as not particularly essential.
Nevertheless, it is a very important
principle to incorporate in one’s business
or sccial habits. When you make an
engagement, respect that engagement sufficiently to be on time, or else don’t

make it. Remember that the cther
person’s time may be valuable.

When you registered at Dalhousie
University, undoubtedly you recognized
that you were making a definite engagement to be present at certain classes at
a certain hour every day in accord with
the established principle or custom of
the University. You are, of course,
respecting that obligation. If not—begin

oday.

Five Cents The Copy

Shirreff Hall Entertains

There’s a noisy rush in the Hall tonight
Supper at six, a tub to win,

My hair to wash and a slip to hem;

An hour to dress e’er the dance begin.

The Residence girls are giving a dance.
Chairs have been grouped around the
halls and pillows of every hue and description are there to ease the weary
dancers. The rooms take on an air
of festive expectancy and the piano
finds itself removed to the dining-room,
which looks bare without its white surpliced tables and straight-backed chairs.
How quickly everyone scurries away
after supper. The corridors resound with
hurrying feet. Mary rushes into Kay’s
room to see if her dress hangs evenly,
and the spray of flowers is in the right
place and Flo hastens upstairs to recover
her slippers and pearls that she Icaned
last night and to get a handkie from
Jean to match her. dress. The bustle
and commotion gradually subsides and
the lights in the rooms die out one by
one. Upstairs quiet reigns once more.
Downstairs the scene grows colorful.
Soft pastel shades with their vivid sisters
mingle with the ever popular black and
white. The scund of voices, laughter,
and excited whispers fill the air. The
door-bell rings intermittently as the
guests arrive.

Come and let me intrcduce you to
Miss Lowe and Florence MacMullen,
our House President—‘The usual three,
yes, fifth and second extra?—yes’’—
Hello, ves, thank you’’—“‘Have you seen

 

Grace, I can’t find her anywhere”—‘‘Isn’t
it crowded”—‘“Have you any dances
left”—*Jim’s looking for you, he’s just |

over there’’—“‘Thirteenth? Yes’ "—‘‘Have
you saved me a dance?’’—‘“Sorry, my
card is filled’ ‘"—“Was ours the seventeenthr’ em dear” *‘This is Mr. Mac—’’
“Any left:’

Then the strains of the Joe Mills
crchestra floated out from the dining
room and,

the couples went in and to and fro
swirled evening-dress and tuxedo.

So the dancing went on. The
punch bowl gathered a large circle of
friends. The library, in its soft coloring,
the more stately drawing-room, the hail
where the men might smoke was successively crowded and deserted as the
party moved to and from the diningroom.

Everywhere friends laughed and talked ;

and the newly acquainted exchanged the
usual remarks. Sometimes the lights in
the dining room were turned out and a
kindly moon shed its soft glow over the
couples gracefully wheeling in and out.
Dr. “Jack” and Mrs, Cameron graced
the merry gathering with their presence
and Prof. Wilson moved about with
his usual smile. (Someone said that he
didn’t mention History once during the
evening. ) Dr. Nichols managed to retain his sense of humor though he tried
to look conventionally bored.

The opening bars of “God Save the
King” brought the party to a stand-still.
With three lusty cheers and a Dal yell,
the guests departed. Much credit is due
to the Dance Committee, ably chaired
by Dorothie Berry for the enjoyable
evening,

 

The Scottish Rectorial

‘‘Here’s to the Rector come to see
The students of this Varsity,
Head o’er all the Profs and we,
The mightiest he in the Varsity.”

The extract from “The Gateway” of
the University of Alberta seems to have
given a strange impression of what a
Scottish Rectorial Election is. It is not
necessarily a political affair though the
candidates chosen may be such that the
fight lies between Liberals and Conservatives. Sometimes the choice is between
politics and literature, at other times it
is between two men of letters, and oftentimes the election is unanimous and
there is no fight at all.

The most interesting point is that if
you take the Rectors of the four Scottish
Universities you are likely to find out
who are the men most admired by the
young folks of Britain at any particular
period. To be Lord Rector of a Scottish
University is an honor highly appreciated
by Scotsmen and Englishmen alike: (the
English Universities have no such honor
to bestow.) “A King can make a belted
knight,”’ he can appoint a University
President, but he can’t appoint a Lord
Rector—only the students can do that.

The oldest Scottish University is that
of St. Andrews which dates back to
1411, and so far as is known the first
Rector was Laurence of Lindores Abbey,
a great theologian of his day. The
Council of Pisa deposed Pope Benedict
in 1409 but the Cathedral and Monasteries of St. Andrews still held him
Pope, and it was to Peniscola in Spain
that a young Scottish graduate cf Paris
travelled to obtain the papal bulls for
the founding of the University and,

according to history, bonfires blazed,
processions of clerics and monks took
place, and the people gave themselves

up to revelry and rejoicing. Fifty years
later, also by papal bulls, the University
of Glasgow was founded amid similar
rejoicings, and the other two, Aberdeen
and Edinburgh, came later. During the
centuries fcllowing, the Scottish King
became King of Britain and the court
migrated to London; the Scottish Parliament was merged in Westminster; the
Reformation swept through the land and
Catholic cardinal and Protestant peasant
alike suffered martyrdom; Flodden Field
wiped out the Scottish nobility and
Culloden Field the gallant Highlanders.
Little of the old Scotland remained except
the Universities, “these frugal seats of
learning where earnest students burned
the midnight oil and kept life together on
a little oatmeal and ale’’.

In the early days Porfessors were
called Regents and the Lord Rectors
were ecclesiastics, and we know the
Rector had often to battle with the
regents over College matters and had
also to act as a buffer between the university and the city—in olden days
there were often pitched battles between
the students and the townsfolk, ‘‘town
and gown”,

 

 

 

A. F.
And now what about the Rectorial
fight? Well, there have been generations

of Rectorial fights and many a time and
oft have the college walls been battered
with peasemeal and rotten eggs and
still they stand, and the old quadrangles
seem none the worse for the battles
that have taken place therein. 1 almost
think Alberta wants to use the recent

fight as a justification for their own
frolics. Scottish students ask for no
justification. To refer to the fight as
a “wanton and vulgar display” is non
sense. It is not a display at all. 1
wonder if Alberta got its information
from a Glasgow Daily that is known in
vulgar parlance as the “H: iulfpenny Liar’’

not so much from its misfacts as from its
attitude which despises culture except of
communistic type and dearly delights
to have a “dig” at the students of the
Varsity. Of course the fight took place
but if the editor of “The Gateway’’

cares to join the students’ tour next
summer and visit Glasgow, I assure him
he won’t smell even the faintest scent
of an egg at Gilmorehill, and I assure

him the more readily in that my Alma
Mater was St. Andrews, and is now
Dalhousie.

The appointing of the Lord Rector is
one of the most notable duties of the
students. The Lord Rectorship is the
one power (students used to have more
power), they have managed to retain
through the centuries. It is a sort of
symbol of independence, it is a reminder
to Senators and University Staffs that
there might be a College without Professors but that without students there
would be no college or need for one.
The Lord Rector is the students’ champion and many Lord Rectors have worked
hard to bring about certain reforms
desired by the students and opposed
by the university. So, though there is
a certain amount of fun and frolic, the
students treat the matter in deadly
earnest and the nominating committee is
chosen with great care. Once the names
of the candidates are out you begin to
work for your man. You make speeches,

you canvas fcr votes, you bribe, if you
can, the fair sex and the stronger sex
alike. The night before the great day

you scorn sleep; you are rallying your
men, you are gathering ammunition; you
are trying tc gain the point of vantage:
you are det tailing your campaign. There
is usually a particular citadel to be
stormed, a particular gate to be held,
Dalhousie Campus does not lend itself
to a siege as there are too many entries
but a Quadrangle makes a good field of
battle. Suppose you are an ordinary
voter. Picture yourself arriving to vote
about 9 a. m. according to instructions to
“come early’, and picture the gates held
by rival parties. The approach to the
gate is guarded by opposing ranks of
convoys and warriors armed with peas,
flour and other more noxious ammunition.
Inside you can hear whoops and yells
and you wonder if you are back in the
days of your forefathers and their fights
with Indians. You see a man try to
enter. You see him received with a
bouquet of flour that makes him a study

A Mental Defeat

Last Saturday Dalhousie was defeated and the Wanderers became
champions for another year. Of this we can only say that we are
deeply disappointed. Our beliefs in lieu of the merits of the two
teams have not wavered because of Saturday’s game, for we, like
you, are Dalhousians. But the firmer our convictions are that
Dalhousie was and is the greater, the more credit must we yield
to her vanquisher.

This final game, however, was not won by either power or skill.
Chance played a great part, as chance always does, and yet there
was acertain other thing. It was not physical fatigue which made Dalhousie weaken when the game was nearly won; nor was it strength
nor skill alone that.gave to her opponents the winning score. This
certain other thing, then, we might call (for want of better words)
the mental attitude of the players.

The game went on quite evenly until the Wanderers scored their
first try and converted it. The Tigers immediately took the offensive and scored twice in rapid succession. In the second period
they continued their offensive tactics for about the first twenty
minutes. Then, when the game was almost over, the Trophy nearly

-won, Dalhousie weakened. The opposing team scored. Again

 

Dalhousie took the upper hand, but it was too late. i

Possibly we are wrong but we ascribe the defeat to overconfidence,
present only for a few minutes, but even then present too long. It
is an old, old fault of Dalhousie’s and one which will handicap her
as long as she permits it to prey upon her.

It would be difficult to accuse Dalhousie of lacking college spirit,
on Saturday. The President, the chairman of the Board of Govyernors, and the deans of three faculties were present, as were

many other professors.

the right, as students, to say that they have disappointed us.

Of those who were not there we have only

The

undergraduates were admirably represented and while they may
be guilty of the same fault of the team of weakening when they
most were needed, they showed that they possessed the true spirit.
The support they gave the team during the last ten minutes was
wonderful and when the final whistle sounded we thought we saw

tears blinkingly repressed from several pairs of eyes.

Possibly it

was that our own vision was rather blurred and what we really saw
were drops of rain, but we sincerely hope that we were not mistaken.

 

 

The Dalhousie Medical Society at its
last monthly meeting gave further evidence of its value asa flourishing and wideawake organization that provides not
only an opportunity for the medical students to become better acquainted, but
also a common meeting-ground with the
members of the faculty, whose more
genial qualities are perhaps somewhat
dulled by the trials of the lecture or clinic
rocm. This gathering teok the form of a
supper at the Green Lantern, and was
largely attended by the members of the
Society. The menu was in the best style
of Mine Host Hart, and left nothing to be
desired. The excellence of the repast was
further enhanced with syncopated melody
dispensed by three musical Meds—Messrs.
Robertson, Thurrott and MacDonald. The
President of the Society, Mr. J. W. Merritt, was at the head of the table, and
around him as guests of honor were Profs.
Hattie, Babkin, Nicholls, Gibbs, Young,
a Dryer, Bean, and Gowanoch.

reported for the Dance Committee, which
staged the best dance for many moons
and turned over a considerable surplus to

presented recommendaticns from a committee appointed to deal with the matter
of an emblem for the Scciety. Dr.
Nichclls, called upon to speak in this ccnnection, emphasized the advisability of
procuring some novel design, and endorsed the suggestion presented by the commitee.

Dr. Hattie was then called upon, and
expressed his pleasure at being present.
He spoke of the necessity of keeping up
the standard of medical education, and
drew many interesting illustrations from
medical education in ancient times.

Dr. Gibbs congratulated the Society
upon the Progress it had made in the last
year, largely due to the fact that an
efficient crganization was in force and the
society running cn a well drawn-up constitution.

that the Dalhousie Review can not be

issue of this year’s Gazette we were
advised to read it and follow world wide
events. The Atlantic Monthly and many
other magazines are available, but our
own college publication has not been

Further, I would like to draw the
attention of the Library Committee to
the fact that many of Dr. McMechan’s

the argument in a very pleasing manner

The Hockey Dance

 

iy

 

evening at 8 o'clock, a

On Friday

.|most enjoyable hockey dance was held

at Shirreff Hall in honor of the Maine
hockey team, when Miss Edith Macneill
manager of the Dal hockey team, proved
a most ming hostess. Only the
two girls’ teams, including spares, managers, linesmen and officers of the D.G.A.C
were present, together with the boys’
hockey team and other Dal boys whe
had helped to make the Maine girls’
stay in Halifax a pleasant one.
Miss Lowe had kindly consented to
allow the drawing-room to be used besides the reception hall and never did
dancers dance so gaily to such excellent
music as was provided by Mr, Keyes.
There seemed to be a spirit of unusual
gaiety in the air despite the fact that
Dal had lost the game that day, while
the extreme friendliness between the two
teams was several times remarked upon
by the visitors who repeatedly spoke of
the kindness shown them. The sixteen
dances and three extras were all
too short and eleven o'clock, when
supper was served, arrived very soon.

After supper all the dances were
“out-ins”, which was particularly satisfactory at this dance for the boys were
ever anxious to obtain the Maine girls
for partners. At 12 o'clock the dance
broke up with loud cheering for ‘‘Maine”’
and the usual Dal yells. The guests
for the evening were Dr. Colvin, the
dean of women in the University of
Maine, Miss Helen Lengyel, Miss Achsa
Bean, Miss Lowe and Prof. Gowanloch.

Oh shimmery thing, all dark and light
You imitate the wild-bird’s flight
A childish toy? Oh yes, but still
Symbolic of the human will
The wish, the great desire to take
Some earthly things and joyful make
Something to imitate the soul
That while eternal ages roll
Flies on—is free.

Oh Shiny Thing that onward flies

Tell me, what’s yonder tin hose skies?
See you the day that sinks to rest?

The moon which at God’s wise behest
Reflects the glory of the sun

When all day's rosy beauty’s done,
And night comes on with rapid pace

With wondrous majesty and grace

O’er land—and sea?

See yon the stars that one by one

Shine out when all day’s toils are done?
What are those worlds so far away?

ls theirs an endless shining day
Or do they cease to shine so bright

When day has vanquished all our night
Tell me, Oh Shimmery Thing, are they

Inhabited by those who play

And work—above?

Tell me, if [had wings to fly

On to those tiny worlds, could |
Diseern their shining vales and hills

And hear the music of their rills?
Or is it that 1 should not know

Those things while here on earth below?

Earth’s sweet contentment not to mar,

But live—and love.

POORFISH

 

A little fish, a swimming in a brook,

Heard of a river lying far beyond.

He sighed, and gave his infant tail a flip,
And said, “I'll leave this silly 1ittle pond.”

A little fish swam out into the stream,

Nor looked he back to flowing waters
cool.

“That surely was an antiquated place

I'll seek for me a faster running pool.”

A little fish, a swimming in a stream,

Thought that the ocean surely must be
great.

“Tis only there I'll find the perfect realm

Of all things wonderful for fish—the gate.”

A little fish, grown weary of his home

Thought of the sleepy sand beds he forsook

He swam back to his silly little pond

Found treasures, that he sought, were in

DALHOUSIE GAZETTE

Delta Gamma

 

The debate at Delta Gamma last
Saturday night was well worth anyone’s
best attention. The subject, “Resolved
that Girls in College Hinder the Schclastic Attainments of the Boys,’’ was one
which in itself called forth spontaneous
attention from the audience. Frem the
beginning to the end, it was a hotly contested debate between Juniors and Sophettes.

The first speaker for the affirmative,
Arley MacDonald, started the ball rolling.
In all seriousness, Arley affirmed that
a girl’s presence in the class room detracted the attention of both professor
and students, due to her attractiveness
of attire.

The negative side of the question was
then propounded by Allison MacCurdy.
Her speech was significant for its systematic arrangement. She clearly brought
out the idea that co-education was a
wonderful factor in the all-round development of the ccllege boy.

The affirmative was upheld by Eveleen
Burns in the third speech for the evening.
She forcibly reminded us that education
was taken far more seriously by the
gentlemen of the nineties than it is by
the lads of the present day, simply
because there were no fair ladies tripping
about the college halls and demanding
attentions, which the youths have no
time to offer.

The last speaker, Jean Shaw, created
a very pleasing effect on her audience.
She maintained that the tuition of the
ladies should be free, their presence in
the college plays such a great part in
the scholastic attainments of the boys,
that nothing short of a course in Feminology ought to be instituted.

A clever and amusing rebuttal between Allison MacCurdy and Eveleen
Burns closed the debate.

After anxiously waiting for the verdict
of the judges, Mary Maclntyre, Gertrude
Mees, and Allison FitzRandolph, the
Juniors were chosen as the. winners of
the debate. Refreshments were served
and the sociable evening came to a close.

Majestic N otes

 

For the balance of this week ‘“Romeo
and Juliet” will be played at the Majestic.
Mr. Sidney Lee, a noted critic declares,
“As a tragic poem on the theme of love
it has no rival in any literature.’’ It
is full-blooded, imbued with the spirit
of youth, and rejoicing (in the character
of Juliet) in one of the most striking
female figures ever drawn by Shakespeare.
Miss Glossop-Harris plays Juliet, while
Mr. Wellesley is in his favorite role as
her lover.

During the whole of next week Miss
Florence Glossop-Harris will present her
farewell performance—‘‘Milestones”’.
“Milestones” is from the pen of Arnold
Bennet and Edward Knoblock. The play
is at once extremely interesting and instructive. The scene is laid in the living
room of a home in Kensington Gore,
England and the theme of the play
concerns the family through three generations. Thus the first act is in the
period of 1860. All the details of dress
and customs are carried out with the
utmost exactitude even to the flickering
candles which light the room. In the
second act the years have rolled on to
1885 and the stage is illuminated by
gas, while the third act represents the
period of 1912. The room is equipped
with electric light and everything posSesses a more modern touch. The ship
building industry is the fundamental of
the plot and there is just the wooden
sailing ship, which is replaced by the
steamboat and finally by the modern
turbine. The play gives a most interesting comparative study of the periods
and is at the same time an intensely
gripping drama.

It is with the very dee é
pest regret that
Halifax theatre patrons will witness the
departure of Miss Florence GlossopHarris and her Company and all hope

that they will return again in the near
future.

Ground Hockey |

Dalhousie vs. Maiue

 

Friday morning, the 13th, dawned
dull and bleak to the dismay of both
the Maine and Dalhousie hockey teams
and by 1.30 the scheduled time for the
game, it was everything that had been
feared—a pouring, beating rain plus a
driving wind. However, the teams ‘assembled on the Dalhousie field for the
first international game in this branch
of sport that has ever been played in
Halifax.

The teams were very evenly matched
although the Maine team seemed to
have been in training for some time.
In the first half the ball went from one
goal to the other and at one time, when
it was in the local’s territory, Bessie
MacDonald secured it and sent it far
to the opposite end. The Maine goalie
was called upon to make some very neat
saves and the ball went again to the
local’s territory. Here Marie Erikson,
the goalie for Dal, saved the situation
several times in a very sensational manner.
Thus the play continued back and forth
and at the end of the first period neither
team had scored.

In the second period, which was faster
and more furious, the ball was agai
brought from goal to goal and although
Edith Macneill captured it, it was soon
sent back to Dal’s goal line where two
bullies were called directly -in front of
the goal. Here, once more, Marie
Erikson did her usual good work.
About the middle of the session, however, Marjorie Jones secured the ball
and with a swift drive scored the only
goal of the game. The Dal girls did
not let that bother them but kept playing
on better and better and the Maine
goalie had to do some swift thinking
and acting to keep the determined girls

scori Dal forced the play to
the end and the whistle blew only too
secon to stop the best hockey game ever
played at Dal. Despite the rain, it was
voted one of the most thrilling events
of this year and never was the rooting
and cheering so well done. The Maine
team showed themselves to be good
sports and this game will likely change
the attitude towards ground hockey to
a considerable degree.

Wanderers Capture McCurdy Trophy

Wanderers won the City League title
at the Wanderers Grounds on Saturday
before the largest crowd that has witnessed a game this year and under practically the same circumstances as in
the first game of the yea:. The Wanderers converted, Dal didn’t.

Dalhousie kicked off with the wind and
the ball was returned to center field.
The Wanderers got two free kicks in
quick succession. Monte relieved with
some great kicks. Wanderers free kicked
to half-line but the ball was worked
back by our half line. Wanderers free
kicked once more to half-line and once
again to 25 yard line. Wanderers got
another free kick and McCoy kicked it
right into the arms of one of Dal’s halves
but muffing it he knocked it on to the
feet of the charging Reds who dribbled
it over for the first touch. Herman
converted.

When play was resumed, Dal got a
free kick and then another one. The
Wanderers relieved with a free kick only
to have Haslam kick it out of touch a
few yards from their line. Wickwire
scored and Haslam converte?. Haslam
missed the posts twice by small margins
on two free kicks, but a few minutes
later almost went over. Murphy went

over in the corner. Monte failed to
convert and the period ended 58-5.
In the second, Dal. didn’t come to

life as quickly as they might have but
they were soon hammering at the Red’s
line. Then came the rain driving right
down the field in a cold stinging sheet.
The Reds, with the rain beating on their
backs and in Dal’s faces, almost went
over twice but Dal held them and getting
free kicks at opportune moments staved
them off until a few minutes before the
end when Lane went. over in a wild
scramble. Hérman kicked the convert
and the ball hit the post poised for a
moment spinning in the air and then
dropped over the bar taking with Dal’s

hope of victory and giving Wanderers
their fourth win since the War.
attacked with great vigor after play
was resumed but the Wanderers were
not going to have victory snatched from
them and theend of the game saw rush and
counter rush, kick and counter kick but
with Dal slowly and surely forging up
the field. The end came with both
teams battling in center field, one flushed
with victory; the other with defeat
staring them in the face.

Taking all in all, it was a very good
and exciting game to watch. The kicking of Haslam, McCoy and
was the great feature of a game that
was all features. Murphy, Haslam, Tupper and Harrington starred for Dal
while McCoy, Hunter, Herman and
Edwards were the Redshirts’ best.
There were nine free kicks handed
out by Lt. Comm. Murray in the first
period, 3 to Dal and 6 to Wanderers,
which more than effectively kept any
pugilistic aspirations that the players
might have had under cover. The team
was backed up by a good Dal turnout,
every part of the University being represented from “Stan” to the greenest
Freshman, all blending their voices to
make some of the best and most consistant rooting heard for a long time.
If the hockey and _ basketball teams
get the support next winter that the
football team got last Saturday, there
should be no complaints on that score.
lt is interesting to note that Saturday’s
victory is the ninth for the Wanderers
since 1892, as against sixteen fcr Dal.

Murphy, “Doe’’ Smith, Meclnnes, Wickwire, Langstroth, “A. C.’’ Smith, Baird,

Wanderers Take
Intermediate Title

 

Dal alsc lost the Intermediate League
by 6-0. Stevenson, of Tech, making
the first touch, which he failed to convert and Clancy, also of Tech, making
the other, also not converted. Wandererers had the edge on the play and kept
things on the go from start to finish.
Dobson and Jones starred for Dal.
The second period was without any
score, bcth touches being made early in
the game. Wanderers’ team was considerably strengthened by the presence

 

of three Tech men. This is also the
ninth win for the Wanderers in this
League since 1892 as against thirteen

for Dalhousie.

Qur Sporting Professors

 

No.1. Prof. Charles H. Mercer.

Many students do not realize that in
our professors we have not only men
learned in their chosen subjects, but also
tennis champions, football heroes, and
hockey stars. One of the foremost among
these is Mr. C. H. Mercer, associate professor of modern language, who has held
various championships in Tennis and
Badminton, and who has always been a
keen sportsman.

Born at Clitheroe, Lancashire, England, Mr. Mercer attended Manchester
Grammar School, where he was captain
of the “under-16” Cricket Team. He
played all kinds of games, and in 1904
was captain of the Manchester University Tennis Six, and also played Lacrosse
for the University Team.

After leaving Manchester, Mr. Mercer
spent several years on the continent,
where he played in tournaments and won
many trophies.

In 1912 Mr. Mercer came to Canada
and taught at Toronto University. From
there he went to Vancouver where he was
on the staff of the University of British
Columbia. In Vancouver Mr. Mercer
played his best tennis. He became Hard
Court Champion of British Columbia in
1919, defeating Marshall Atlan of Seattle,

players.

In 1921 Mr. Mercer accepted his present
| post at Dalhousie.
in the winter, and tennis in the summer,
and is a member of the South End Tennis
Club and the Dalhousie Badminton Club.

) Since his arrival in Halifax Mr. Mercer

has held the following titles:

TENNIS.
Maritime 1923.

Doubles

Singles,
