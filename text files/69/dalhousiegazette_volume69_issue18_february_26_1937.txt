Urges Support

“In an effort of this magnitude,
organization is necessary. The main
work of the committee now is to create
this organization. This can be done
by no one man or any committee—it
must be the concerted eftort of all those
who are interested in the history of the
university and its future. On the success of this reunion depends the whole
future of Dalhousie university. All
Dalhousians—past and present—are requested to become part of this organization through the alumni _ associations, class organizations and district
committees. This having been done,
they should get in touch with the reunion chairman at the Nova Scotia
Board of Public Utilities, Provincial
Administration Building, Halifax, N.S.

“This is a university undertaking and
should be the work of every person who
ever attended the university. The reunion should bring together at least
two thousand Dalhousians, Our slogan
is—Come to Halifax for the 1938 Reunion.”

Sport Broadcast

This week's feature was an interview
with prominent Dal sport officials on
the general theme of Dalhousie at play.
Roland Hurst, news editor of the Gazette, interviewed Pat Gunter, football captain, Tom Sheehan, Manager
of hockey, Edward Barnhill, President
of D. A. A. C., J. D. Crease, basketball captain, on Dal sport past and
present and some interesting data was
forthcoming. John Fisher, introduced
the programme in his own inimitable
manner,

Delegates Gather

Welcome to the distinguished representatives of Acadia, Mount-Allison,
University of New Brunswick and St.
Francis Xavier. It is with pleasure
and a great deal of pride that our local
Universities are host to-day and receive
an unusually large delegation for the
annual Session of the Model Assembly
of the League of Nations. A complete
representation of all maritime Universities has not thus been seen for quite
some time. We hope that their stay
on our campus will be a most emjoyable
and profitable one.

In endeavouring to draw an interesting and educational agenda, the Committee had in mind specially the international problems which confront the
Youth of our day. Those which treat
with War and Peace are indeed the
most concerning.

The general student body is welcomed in the gallery of Haliburton
room and undoubtedly from attendance
at the Session one may abstract valuable knowledge.
This afternoon the discussion will
be of Canada’s policy in case of war.
Tonight the delegates will be the guests
of the Dramatic Club’s ‘‘Hay Fever.”

Tomorrow morning, the programme
will consist of a model imperial conference, concluding witha banquet at noon.

This morning the Colonial Problem,
and the Pan-American Union question
were discussed.

 

Mount A. Debate

An excellent team of debaters composed of Henry Hicks and Leonard
Kitz received a two-one decision in
Sackville last Friday. They were upholding the affirmative of ‘‘Resolved
that man should be compelled to retire at 65”.

Mr. George Buckley, chairman,
opened the debate with interesting remarks. L. Kitz presented his ripened
arguments in an outstanding form.
This was his first intercollegiate debate
and from all comments, this speaker,
the latest achievement of the Effective
Speaking Club, made an extremely
good showing. And of course Henry
Hicks in the usual, inimitable style of
his, brought much weight in this tilt.
On the closing of the meeting, Leo A.
Landreville, president of Sodales who
had sojourned with the team, commented upon the event and expressed
his gratitude for the usual outstanding hospitality of the host University.

Saturday saw our trio back in Halifax, jubilant and anxious to tell everyone of the complete success of the trip.

Beatty Vividly Portrays
Canada’s Railway Problem

“The whole theory of recapitalization of the Canadian National Railways is obviously dominated by a misconception.” Sir Edward Beatty,
President of the Canadian Pacific Railway told a meeting of the Dalhousie
University Institute of Public Affairs
here last Friday.

Speaking on the subject, ‘Canada's
Railway Problem,” the C. P. R. head
told of plans to reduce the debt ofthe
government road and said such plane
were NOT feasible and were the result
of a ‘“‘misconception”’ of the capital
structure of the Canadian National.

“The Canadian National Railways
is not a private corporation,” he said.
‘While it has this legal form, it is, for
all practical purposes, a department
of the Dominion Government. It
can never divest itself of one dollar of
obligation by any process of writing
off or of bankruptcy.

“Every dollar which the government
has ever advanced to the Canadian
National, and every dollar which the
Canadian National owes the Government and fails to pay, either for principal or interest, represents a dollar
which the Government of Canada
borrows from private capitalists and
will pay back.

“The Government of Canada is involved as a result of its railway adventures to an amount in excess of
$3,000,000,000. The annual burden
on the taxpayers of this country as a
result of these adventures is the interest
on at least this amount of money, less
any net operating profits which the
system might produce.”

It had been suggested Mr. Beatty
continued, that the accounts of the
system should be kept on such a basis
as to reduce the deficit for 1935 from
the $115,281,689 recorded on _ the
company’s books and which included
interest charges, to $47,500,000 to
cover “the so-called cash deficit.’
Such a plan overlooked the fact that

the government was eventually
sponsible for the complete deficit he
claimed.

I have considerable sympathy with
the obvious desire to make sure that
the operations of the C. N. R. do not
appear more unprofitable than they
really are. Asa citizen of this country,
however, I have no sympathy with any
attempt to lead the people of Canada
to underestimate what
policy to date has cost us.

“IT can see that a plan to write off
the past expenditures
on the Canadian National would make
the deficits of the railway appear less
than they
of contradiction, that

Government's

I say, without fear
the Minister of
custodian of the
public funds of this country, cannot
pretend for the moment that the losses
of the Canadian National
recorded in 19385 were

$115,281.689 or that any
ment of bookkeeping will alter the
facts of the case by one cent.”

Turning to the proposed settlement
of the question approved by himself,
Sir Edward suggested unification of
the Canadian National and the Canadian Pacific ‘‘for the purpose of administration.”

“Ofticers of the Canadian Pacific
Railway repeatedly pointed out to
the Government that one transcontintental system was all that the commerce of this country could support.
They pointed out that the Grand
Trunk was making a grave error in attempting to enter the western field.

Dear Sir:

While deeply appreciative of
the honour conferred upon me
of being nominated as a candidate for the Presidency of the
Students’ Council in the forthcoming elections, nevertheless
after much consideration I have
come to the conclusion that I
should withdraw my name from
the nomination lists.

Next year is my last year at
Dalhousie and | feel that in fairness to my studies I could not,
if elected, aevote the time necessary for the efficient performance of the difficult and unappreciated work of President, the
true nature of which I have only
recently been able to appreciate.

Yours sincerely,

| -INTERCOLLEGIATE HOCKEY

= A few weeks ago our pessimistic Dalhousian sport fans were
saying that it looked as if the football team would be the only
one to carry off championship laurels. Now, however, the scene
has changed. We have in our midst a band of stalwarts on the
intercollegiate hockey team which is, at the date of writing, sweep_ ing opposition before it, and whose record is putting the basketball team and the senior hockey team to shame. Congratulations,
___ boys, keep it up.

a The intercollegiate rules for the Maritimes are unique among
intercollegiate sport unions—they provide that no degree-holder
_ may participate. Such rules are obviously for the benefit of the
_ smaller colleges in the Maritimes and to the disadvantage of
_ Dalhousie. In spite of this handicap, however, we have long
__ thought that more serious consideration should be given the
question of participation by Dalhousie in intercollegiate athletics.
_ The D. A. A. C. are to be strongly congratulated for their initiative
and judgment in making this experiment in hockey this year—
____ the results clearly show that they made no mistake.

THE GYMNASIUM QUESTION

a The gymnasium problem—the problem of balancing and
____ ¢o-ordinating activities and giving each its fair share of time—
is still far from solution. A combined meeting last Monday
+; __ between the Senate and Student Committees, presided over by
___ the President, ended with no substantial progress being made.
a Let us present the facts. The C. O. T. C., in return, so
_ we understand, for something between $600 and $850, get the
_ gymnasium Monday nights and cannot be budged from it—(this
_ amounts, surely, to something very near official university sponsorship of the C. O. T. C. militarist program). The girls with the
_ aid of the faculty have Tuesday hight, and in spite of the fact
_ that a mere handful of girls use it and that they, being almost
entirely Arts and Science, have plenty of spare time during the

Plea Against Prejudice

Munro ‘Day, that somewhat overrated occasion of boisterous athletic
vigour, and scholarly release of restraint, is approaching. We_ heard
someone define it as “too much of
nothing’ and we heartily endorse the
statement. Somehow it always reminds us vaguely of a Sunday School
picnic.

With Munro Day comes the adjudging of the Malcolm Honor Award.
Let’s hope that those selected to make
the choice will be competent judges.

We were pleasantly surprised to
discover that our worthy guest artist
the Fed-Up Junior had evoked over
two column’s worthy of hearty comment in last week’s Gazette. Seriously, we are thinking of taking him into
partnership. Any one who can create
the noise that he undoubtedly did
is fulfilling the primary duties of a

columnist. He looks like a natural
to us.
However, before we present the

rest of his little efforts we should
like to state that we are not necessarily
in accordance with his views. In
fact we are in—shall we say mild—
disagreement with him. Of course
there are exceptions to every rule....
heavens people, don’t misunderstand
us; we only meant....oh well....
presenting to you the idol of Halifax
womanhood:

THE FED-UP JUNIOR!

My Dear Publie:—

With the kind permission of the
genial writer of this column, who has
graciously consented to forfeit a few
inches of his valuable space, 1 would
like to take this opportunity to express
my gratitude and soul-felt apprecia
|tion of the kind words and thoughts
|which so many expressed toward

me in the last issue of this, the premier
College newspaper of the North American Continent. However, my modesty
compells me to admit that I am not
the model youth you set me up as
being—not quite anyway.

I wish especially to convey my
thanks to ‘Catty”’, be you “she’”’ or
“tom”, or “chessy”’, to ‘All Wet”
who outdid himself in his kindness,
even though his understanding of
English and the use of grammar might
not be up to Prof. Bennett’s ideal.

As to the success of my campaign
dear fellows, I would like to reassure
you of its progress. Already I have
noted a marked improvement in the
‘patients, not only in their hospitality
but in their general views regarding
my subject. Such prompt reaction
and progress assures me of the fact
that ‘‘our cause is good’’, and prompts
me to investigate other fields which
seem to leave room for improvement,
But before I. make such a move I
should like a vote of confidence to
be expressed through the Gazette
that the students as a whole wish
for the continuance of my little movement, which for reference’s sake I
have appropriately dedicated “The
Home _Lover$ Plan”. If you will
remember, the combined efforts of
two of the more active of our group,
(may they “go forth and multiply’’)
had a delightful suggestion as to what
should be served to the visiting boyfriend. It found over the week-end
that sponge cake and milk make adelightful luncheon about the midnight hour. Try it girls, if any of
you have the charm which is required
to keep a man awake until that time.

In response to the constructive
criticism of the above-mentioned ‘All
Wet” (ardent admirer), I have decided
to divorce myself from “foul liquor”.
Though too late to come under the
heading of a New Year's Resolution
I have solemnly resolved that in the
future I will drink nothing but the
best brands.

In closing I wish to repeat my
feeling of security, brought about by
your faithful support and to request
all to prod me to further efforts. My
talents are broad, may they not be
wasted.

Yours in co-education,

THE OVER-FED JUNIOR.

hat’s Wrong In
The Maritimes

(Concluded)

In addition to their regular professional duties at the University,
members of the faculty give Extension
Lectures in various districts in the
Maritime Provinces. The greater part
of this work is done between January
and April, and during the past month
almost every district in Nova Scotia
has been visited. The Lectures are
given weekly or fortnightly and are
arranged in tours, the professor speaking in two or more tours in that district
on one trip. Speakers have been
going fortnightly to Cape Breton,
speaking in the Sydneys and Glace
Bay; to New Glasgow and Stellarton;
Lockeport and Shelburne; Saint John
Moncton and Amherst; to Stewiacke
fortnightly where a course of six
lectures is being delivered; to Windsor
every Tuesday. Lectures have also
been delivered in Truro, Sackville,
and Fredericton, Berwick, Springhill
and Bridgetown. |

The group giving these lectures
include Drs. Wilson, Stewart, Richter,
R. A. Mackay, Professors Fletcher,
Adshead, Pearson, Douglas, Harvey,
Dean MacDonald and Professors Curtis
and Willis of the Law School.

Dr. Stewart has been speaking on
“Can British Imperialism Last?” Dr.
Wilson on “The Present European
Situation’, Dean MacDonald, ‘The
Law and the Motorist,’’ Prof. Fletcher,
“The Parent and the Child of School
Age’, Mr. Adshead, ‘‘Changing Germany’; Mr. Harvey, “New Scotland
in Acadia”, Prof. Douglas, ‘‘Geology
of Canada,’”’ Mr. Willis, ‘Governmental Interference in Business’, Dr.

Steps already taken.

Doctor: ‘And tnat habit of talking
to yourself—there’s nothing to worry
about that.”

Patient: ‘“‘Perhaps not, but I’m such
a damned bore.”

Concurrent with the change in
events and centralization of industry
in Ontario and Quebec there has arisen
a belief that these central provinces
control and in fact dictate the economic
life of the Maritimes. No doubt
much is to be said for this contention,
But behind this centralization, however, supposedly lurks the root of all
evil—confederation. The result has
been the establishment of numerous
commissions and boards to investigate
and recommend solutions. Various so
called “Maritime Rights’ have become the fashion. There are as many
expressed rights as there are spokesmen. The road to Ottawa is strewn
with the corpses of disappointed commissioners, petitioners and redressers.
Few of them have had any concrete
proposal to present at Ottawa but
they all exert some “right’’ under the
British North America Act. Instead
then of tackling the problem and
setting their own house in order the
politicians and leaders have taken
the line of least resistance and treked
to Ottawa to assert some nebulous
Maritime right. The result has gained

DALHOUSIE GAZETTE

St. F. X. Victors
In Radio Debate

Last Friday evening Dalhousie radio
debaters were forced to concede victory
to the team from St. Francis Xavier
University, and practical application
of modern political principles bowed to
uncontrolled idealism in a most penetrating discussion of. the resolution
“That Under Present World Conditions Dictatorship Is Preferable to the
Parliamentary System.” The result
of this loss is that Dalhousie is eliminated from further competition in the
current series of C. B. C. debates and
that St. F. X. must alone carry the
Maritime colours into the final rounds
of the contest.

The fact that the judges themselves
disagreed on the outcome is a clear indication of the closeness of the debate.
The eloquence of Roger Rand, and the
logic of Danny Halpern, of Dalhousie,
were strikingly in contrast with the
more pedestrian arguments of their opponents. In upholding the negative
of the resolution, the Dal team carried
the fight into the enemy’s camp and effectively compared modern dictatorships with their consequent glorification of war, postulation of non-existent racial superiorities, deification ofunworthy individuals, and _ suppression of human liberties, with démocracy, which, though admittedly imperfect, guarantees those personal liberties and personal responsibilities
which it is the duty of the state to provide. To this apparently unanswerable flood of rhetoric Donald Dickson
and Herman Timmons replied that our
present world difficulties have been
caused by a prostitution of liberties
and can only be remedied by a voluntary relinquishment by the people of
some of their privileges. They traced
the system of dictatorship throughout
history and contended that it is a necesSary emergency measure, which should
be only temporary in duration and
need not be accompanied by violence
or bloodshed. They offered no reason
why democratic countries have more
successfully weathered the depression
than those governed by dictators; and,
which is very important now that civilization has been dedicated to the
system because of their eloquence, they
advanced no means whereby a dictator
can be removed from power if he is unwilling to surrender his office. But
such arguments were not called for by
the resolution, and our opponents
wisely confined themselves to an advocacy of a perfect system to right the
wrongs of an imperfect society. The
result for them was victory.

“Hay Fever’’

Tonight, at 8.30, the newly formed
Dalhousie Dramatic Society, conceived
for the purpose of bringing the works
of contemporary playwrights to the
Dalhousie stage, will present its first
play, ‘Hay Fever’, a comedy by Noel
Coward in three acts.

Telling the story of a hectic week-end
spent by an eccentric family and their
four conventionally typed guests, “Hay
Fever” is considered to be the finest
production of Coward's sophisticated
wit. The starring role of JudithBliss,
a retired actress with a weakness for
dramatising every situation with which
she comes in contact, is taken by Mary
Marsh; Jack Arnell portrays David,
her novelist husband, a gentleman of
casual manners and overemphasized
poise; Jean Fitzgerald her frank but
sane daughter, Sorel, who is trying to
remain as normal as possible in the
face of the overwhelming influence of
her anomalous family;and Steve Macnutt her son Simon, a precocious caricaturist,
matched only by his total lack of restraint.

The four bewildered guests are played
by: Bud Macdougall as thetactful diplomatist, whose professional attributes
undergo their greatest strain during his
short stay; Marjorie MacLean as the
self-possessed about. town,”
who gets a little more than she bargained for when she comes down on
Simon’s invitation for the purpose of
enmeshing David; Betty Pearson as the
“sweet young thing’ who finds herself
completely out of place and unable to
adjust herself to surroundings;
and Charlie Roberts the hearty
young amateur boxer whose lack of in
whose supreme rudeness is

telligence relieves him from what otherwise might have been a rather painful
state. Margaret Schwartz plays the
part of Clara, the maid, whose comments on the sequence of events adds
much to the humour of the comedy.

The play is under the direction of
Mrs. Leslie Pigot, of the Theatre Arts
Guild, and Mr. Pigot, the secretary and
director of the same organization, has
lent much valuable assistance. Bob
Begg is stage manager, and the set and
props have been provided and constructed by the Glee Club who have
lent invaluable cooperation. This is
the next-to-last show of the year with
the Glee Club Munro Day production
“Leave it to Smith” by P. G. Wodehouse, now under rehearsal, winding
up the schedule.

Dalhousie’s entry in the Maritime
Intercollegiate playdowns advanced an. other step in their march towards the

r when they held Acadia to a 5-3 score.
| Although beaten in the first game, the

Dalhousiansemerged on top in the two

having won the first game 7-3.

In battling their way to the Nova
Scotia finals, for the first time in many
years, the Tigers turned in a splendid
exhibition of brainy hockey. It is no
small feat to hold the speedy Acadians

in their home rink, and the Dal boys
deserve great credit.

Down four goals, the Axemen threw
caution to the wind and pressed franti
| cally from the opening whistle. Coach

Pete Macdonald, had his charges play a
ee: waiting game and wait for the breaks
and this system worked perfectly. If
. the Tigers had made use of half of their
chances they would have come out on
top by a larger margin.

Marshall, former Interfaculty star,
sent Dal ahead when he whizzed the
! puck into the net, but Acadia fought
: back and went into a one goal lead.

Napier thencame through to even the
count. The Valley lads rapped in
, another pair of goals and were becomek ing very dangerous.when Jim Mont

Council Meets

The paid jobs existing at Dalhousie
provided the spotlight as the Council
of Students met last Sunday afternoon
to consider the various applicants for
the salary positions in connection with
the student life of Dalhousie.

The first application to come up
was in connection with the editors of
the Dalhousie Gazette.

Two teams of applicants—the first
that of Messrs. Hurst and Merchant,
the second of Messrs. T. B. Parlee and
Ben Rogers. It was around the first
applicant that the stormy controversy
arose.

Violent assertions that the destiny
of the masses were in the hands of a
select few who controlled everything
in and about the land of Dal, resulted
in the motion that Mr. Hurst be asked
to withdraw from the Freshman Representative position in favor of the
Gazette. Mr. Hurst after consideration announced his withdrawal from
the Gazette application. On the motion of Mr. Hurst it was decided to
give the matter a one week hoist that
the other member of the team, Mr.
Merchant might get another man to
apply with him...... Passed.

Business Manager of the Gazette,
Two applications. Mr. G. K. Daley.
Mr. Robert Armstrong. The two advances separate applications. The case
of too much for too few did not hold
in this case, however, and the position
was awarded to Mr. Daley with the
recommendation that he request Mr.
Armstrong to go into the matter on the
joint arrangement so successfully used
this year.

The principle bouquet of the week in
our opinion goes to
the Intercollegiate
Hockey team for defeating Acadia in the
provincial semi-finals,
Although losing at
Wolfville the boys
were able to pile upa
sufficient lead in the
first encounter to take the round by a
two goal margin. Koretsky seems to
have been the individual star of the
game and we feel that he too deserves
a pat on the back. This net minder
has improved greatly since the season
started and according to what we hear
was all that stood between victory and
defeat. The Hockeyists shouldn't feel
too downhearted over losing their game
because its pretty hard to dull the Axe
in its sheath. Many another team has
found that out to its sorrow.
Dalhousie line-up—Anderson, Hall 4,
Pentz 2, Dauphinee, Armstrong, Woolaver, Stewart, Douglas, Hartling.

 

Speaking of Acadia brings us to the
basket-ball game Wednesday night.
At the time of writing, the games
haven’t been played so we feel free to
do a little talking. The Tigers are out
of the League for sure, but they would
still get a big kick out of taking their
collegian foes over the hurdles. The
hoopsters are all steamed up over the
fourteen point shellacking administered the last time Dal and Acadia met
and there's nothing they rather do
than revenge this set-back. Whether
their spirit is stronger than their basket
ball ability will be proven by the time
you read this.

We've heard many complaints about
the lighting facilities of the gymnasium
around the Campus of late. It seems
strange that the largest gymnasium
lin Eastern Canada and the home of
| many championship teams can’t be
/ properly illuminated. Its particularly
bad at the westernend where some
kind of a shadow seems to be cast.

| We think something should be done
because its a decided handicap to play
any kind of a sport under a defective
lighting system. Lets see some action
from the Gym. Committee!

“Perseverance is the best road to
success’’, so believes Rod Adeson, Dalhousie court star. After the last few
basket-ball practices he has been observed industriously working to perfect
his long shot, and as a result almest

won the game for the Tigers on Wednesday night. He turned his best
game of the season both offensively and
defensively, but it was his sensational
shooting that stole the show. Carrying the whole team on hisshoulders he
threw basket after basket from

fans to their feet time and again.

The various Inter-faculty leagues
march on apace with Law looking

like potential champs in the realm of
bas ket-ball. We wonder if they can
continue with the loss of certain Senior
players. The use of the gymnasium
for soft-ball on Saturday afternoons
was a step in the right direction. Maybe
this sport will have better turnouts
under these new conditions. Hockey
continues with the Frosh surprising
everyone by displaying great form.
Considered dark horses after their weak
showing in foot-ball, they’ve come back
strong on ice and look good to cop the
title.

The City Hockey League had a banner season this winter as far as gathering in points is concerned. What the
League lost in customers they made up
in the number of goals scored. Strange
or rather sad to relate Dal figured in
the majority of such games, usually
on the short end. The biggest crop
collected was in the game in which
Tramways rung up fifteen while the
Tigers ably assisted by scoring nine
markers. Twenty-four goals a game
isn’t a bad record—it shows good
marksmanship or something. Anyhow the Tigers were put out of the
League race and our only hope for
laurels hangs on the fortunes of the
Intercollegiate sextette.They got past
Acadia without much trouble, but
they’ll have to watch themselves with
St. Francis Xavier. The Saints have
one of the best outfitsthat have fallen
to them in some years and if the Tigers
are to win it will only be after a hard
fight. As far as we know it will be a
sudden death contest Halifax
Friday night so lets have as many
rooters out as the Forum can hold.

It has just been brought to our attention that according to the revised
Constitution, gold Athletic D’s will be
presented to those that earn them the
year they are won instead of the year
the winner graduates. This is a great
improvement over the old method and
the D. A. A. C is to be congratulated
for taking such a step. We never
could see much point to owning one
after you've left college, for itson the
Campus that it is recognized and its
value known. Now, however, any
qualifying athlete is privileged to wear
one of these coveted distinctions, and
it will be presented to him on Munro
Day of the year it is won.
