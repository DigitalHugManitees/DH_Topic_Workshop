Sodales Plan For Very

Active Debating Season

Faithful to its tradition of aflording®—

the Dalhousian every opportunity of
developing his  oratorical talents,
Sodales has at present a program that

_ will make this year a red letter number

in its archives. The Executive has
during the Summer made contact with
Maritime and Upper Canadian Universities and a score of debates have
already been arranged.

The opening and outstanding debate
of the year is to be held on October
20th when Sodales will receive a team
of two debaters from England. Trials
for the selection of an opposing team
are to be held shortly. Following
this event, a team comprising a St.
Francis Xavier and a Dalhousie student
will make an extensive tour of the
Universities of the Provinces of Quebec
and Ontario.

In November Dalhousie will be
visited by speakers of Mount Allison,
St. Francis Xavier, Acadia and King's.
Return visits are to be made. Sodales

' has taken this year the initiative in

organizing an elimination system of
Radio Debates for the Maritime

of the City Debating League. Sodales

will this year compete against St.

Mary’s and Y. M. C. A. teams. _Interfaculty debates should create some
interesting animosity when representatives will attempt to resolve definitely
the debateable question: What
profession is the most important to
humanity.

In February, Dalhousie will compete
for the National Trophy in the yearly
series of the Canadian Radio Commission debates. Due to the helpful
suggestions and guiding hand ofa
few professors, Sodales has always
made a good showing and suffered
elimination only in the final events.
With their support and a measure
of good fortune, the Trophy should
this year come to Halifax. Strong
in the belief that Sodales is a Debating
Society the object of which is to
develop latent talents, the Executive
will inaugurate a series of three lectures
on Public Speaking. These addresses
are expected to be very educational,
interesting and attended by the student
body as a whole.

Dal. and King’s have the honor

this year of receiving the delegates for
the annual session of the Model League
of Nations.
_ To the Freshman class and to the
new students at Dalhousie, the Executive wishes to point out that the
coveted gold ‘‘D’’ can be earned by
participating in two major debates
during a student’s college career.
Any registered student is eligible,
so follow the advertisements and rest
assured that a most hearty welcome
will greet you at the meetings.

In a rugged hard-fought match in

' university course in Public Administration, the first of its kind in
Canada will be given this year in the
University. This course is designed
particularly for students looking forward to a career in the Civil Service
(Federal, Provincial or Municipal).
It should be of great value to students
looking forward to such professions
as Law or Journalism, or other careers
having to do with public affairs
Its aim is to provide the necessary
background rather than a_ technical
training.

The need for special training for
candidates for the public service is
apparent. To carry out efficiently
the many tasks imposed upon the
modern government by its expansion
into economic and social] spheres, it
needs an administrative staff of high
ability and sound education. Special
training for prospective civil servants
has long been provided by the University of London, and, more recently,

by other universities in the British
Empire, as well as by a few American
universities, notably Harvard and
Chicage. Hitherto no Canadian
university has undertaken work in
this field. Dalhousie is, therefore

a pioneer in offering this course, as
it was when it established the first
academic law school in Canada more
than half a century ago.

To supplement this new course
the Institute of Public Affairs
been set up to promote the cause of
good administration. The Institute

student interest in sport.
In every sphere of student activity unequalled opportunities
for worthwhile student participation await us. Let us take
advantage of them. If the appeal of college spirit leaves you
cold consider at least the value to yourself to be gained, of the
chances to broaden your interests, and to have a good time.
Dalhousians—Dalhousie needs you and you need Dalhousie.
Let us blend the two in an unmatched combination—a new and

_ Heartiest congratulations are due the University authorities

and for the inauguration of the Institute of Public Affairs. Such

t credit must go to all those who sponsored the inception
this course and to the University which made it possible.
The inauguration of this new course is important also as a

COMMENT |

THE REPUBLICANS AND MAINE.

Last week Americas political eyes
were cast upon the northerly farm
state of Maine, for in this back state
of the great American nation the people
went to the polls to elect a Senator,
Governor, three Representatives and
less important officials. The voice
was republican. The next day optimism and courage rang out in republican
headquarters as committeemen were
told that, ‘As Maine goes, so goes the
nation.” They proclaimed it a Landon
year. But Mr. James A. Farley and
Democratic chieftains on the contrary
said that a Republican Maine means
a landslide for Roosevelt.

Why is the voting in Maine of such
significance? Why was it in the
city of Portland that Governor Landon
made a hurried eleventh hour speech?
Furthermore, why do both Republicans
and Democrats claim beneficial significance from a Republican state victory?

The Constitution of the United
States declares that the presidential
elections shall take place in the month
of November. Maine like other states
will vote then. The polling that she
just witnessed is a_ state election, |
supposedly to deal with local affairs.
Maine being the most northerly state
has long and early winters. Before
the advent of the automobile, roads
in Maine were not good; it was difficult
for the rural folk to reach the polling
booths in November. It will be
remembered that much of Maine's
topography is mountainous and the
communties are thus isolated. Consequently Maine held her State elections
in September and being a rural and
conservative state somewhat like our
Maritimes they have never relinquished
the practise. Since the days of the
civil war Republicans politicians have
controlled Mainee, thus they like to
make election talk by showing Maine
to be the national barometer. It is
a catching phrase and because Maine

Something To
Think About

The Nazi pageant of unity and
strength at Nurenburg has left an
aftermath of conflicting opinions on
the part of international - political
observers. Our opinion is that the
Nurenburg convention throws no light
on future German policy. The precise
aims of Hitler were by no means
elucidated by the bombastic oratory
undoubtedly designed for home consumption and the inspiration of party
loyalty rather than as an actual
exposition of German foreign policy.
Hitler’s reference to the Russian
Ukraine as a desirable granary for
the German nation, his impassioned
invectives against bolshevism are capable of an equivocal interpretation.
These utterances definite as they are
do not necessarily mean that the Nazis
are actually contemplating a war
with Russia. They may have been
made solely for the purpose of sub-|
stituting bolshevism as a new scapegoat in place of ‘‘international Jewry”’.
The Nazis may be merely again
utilizing the fact that the fear of an
external enemy is a great force con-|
ducive to solidarity and loyalty within |
the nation, The attack on bolshevism
can well be merely Nazi strategy to
prevent dissension at home by dangling
anew “bogey man’”’ before the German
people, a Russian communist in place
of the overworked German Jew. The
sincerity of Hitler's desire for colonies
as expressed in his Nurenburg speech
is similarly doubtful. Embarrasing as
it was to the pro-German factions in

England it is so inconsistent with
Hitler’s policy of eliciting British
sympathy. that it too can well be

simply the offering of an excuse for
the Nazi failure to alleviate Germany’s
economic ills. Future events alone
will show whether the Nurenburg
speech was solely a matter of party

 

 

| bombers

 

under a dictatorship as under Democracy) or a genuine forecast of future
German policy.

 

 

Although the Nurenberg convention
failed to produce any clues as to
German foreign policy it did disclose
one fact that cannot be doubted.
The convention disclosed that Der
Fuehrer is one of the world’s greatest
showmen. The exact status of the
former house painter, whether he is
an intelligent leader or merely a mad
emotionalistic demagogue, is a matter
of opinion (the latter predominating)
but his position as a superb mob
psychologist cannot be assailed. For
dramatic display and sheer emotional
appeal the Nurenburg pageant made
Mussolini’s balcony performances appear like the amateur efforts of a
Theatre Arts Guild. The dimming.
of the lights in the vast stadium while
the thousands of spectators stood at
silent attention was nothing new on
similar emotional displays of Democratic countries for their war dead,
But the scene where thousands of
picked members of the worker’s corps
marched into the stadium in perfect
military formation, shouldering spades
in place of rifles, their bodies stripped
to the waist, their powerful shoulders
and bronzed chests displaying health
and vigour, their standing at attention
before Hitler, the sound of a voice,
arising somewhere from the _ vast
depths of the stadium, its deep cadence
giving the effect of some great Nordic
God speaking to his people, the questions of the unknown voice as to
what National Socialism had done
for labour and then the answer of
the workmen, their voices rising in
unison, extolling the position of labour
under National Socialism; the military |
scene in which motorized anti-aircraft
contigents rushed into the = arena,
placed their guns in position, repulsed
an air attach then replaced the guns
and rapidly dashed out of the arena,
the whole sham air attack and repulse
having taken but two minutes, displayed the artistic taste in Hitler,
in his early days as a landscape painter
a failure but as a big scale theatrical
producer undoubtedly successful. |

 

The assurance of foreign correspondents in terming the Spanish war
a “civil” war is not quite justifiable
when one considers the personnel of
the belligerent forces. The nucleus
of the insurgent forces are turbanned
Mohammedans from Morocco. The
long knives of these swarthy descendants of former invaders were used
with signal success in the capture of
Irun. The attack on Madrid is being
facilitated by the successful bombardment of aircraft of Italian and German
manufacture and manned by Italian
and German pilots. It is now an

oy Casts Pearls

Before Swine

From the day we enter college till
the day we step on the convocation
platform the high ideals of what a
college education stands for are drummed into our heads morning, noon
and night, Words of inspiration and
fatherly advice, and of admonition
|and remonstration for failing to heed
‘these words, are cast at us broadside.
| Until we become so conditioned to
‘the stimulus that it evokes no response
whatever. I fear that often the worthy
speakers feel that they are casting
| their pearls before very unresponsive
| swine. The following which we shall
/now quote is, however, in a class by
itself, one which will impress even
the most hardened speech hearer.
|It was given by Mr. Justice Oliver
| Wendell Holmes more than thirtyyears when speaking at
Harvard:

“Your education begins when you
have begun yourselves to work upon
the raw material for results which
you do not see, cannot predict, and
which may be long in coming, when
you take the fact which life offers you
for your appointed task. No man
has a right to intellectual ambition
until he has learned to lay his course
by a star he has never seen—to dig
by the divining rod for springs which
he may never reach. In saying this,

R. V. Champ. |

In this case the prisoner, Bob.
Champ, was charged with the theft

=," of a blind date from one Rob Chump

The case was tried before Mr. Justice
_ Sleepwell and the prosecution was
conducted by the Crown Proosecutor,
_ Mr. Guy Smart, while Ab Sorbine, Jr
____ Of the firm of Sorbine, Sorbine, Waxbene, and Hasbene appeared for the
defence.
It appears that the prisoner lived
in the same house with Chump, and
also one Lem Mann Naid who had
a sister, a freshette, Sarah Naid.
Naid, having promised his mother

came from a remote section of Cape
Breton and didn’t have any acquain
tances at Dalhousie, persuaded Chump
to have a “‘blind date’’ with her after
showing him her picture. Champ

_ also saw the picture and decided that

‘she was much too good looking a

c ra | lady for a homely chump like Chump
but would suit a handsome chap like

Champ. Devising in his nefarious

mind an infamous scheme, he, the
prisoner, called up Miss Naid, and

_ having heard her brother arrange
the date for 8 p. m., asked her if she
could be ready by 7.45. She could,
she would, she did. Thus due to
the similarity of names and the fact
that Miss Naid had met neither Mr.
Chump nor the prisoner, Champ,
this grand larceny was carried through
and the prisoner spent a very enjoyable
evening while Chump anathematized

" During the course of the trial his
lordship remarked that he didn’t
know what a blind date was. He

i had heard of dated coffee, but never
a of dated blinds, although he had

heard of dated blondes. He supposed

a blind date was a date without sight,
but any date is without sight since,

b- unlike potatoes, dates have no eyes.

Mr. Smart explained that a “blind

SODALE’S HEAD GOES
ASTRAY

It is a well known fact that Leo
Landreville, popular president of the
Sodales Debating Society has since
his return to the university gone to
no little effort to obtain a trophy for
his proposed Maritime Radio Debate.

But. it was with deep regret that

_ we learn that a student so prominent
in campus affairs stoops to such a
crime as housebreaking.

The crime in question is alleged to
have been on the eve of September
22nd when after returning from a
little party with friends he was let
out quite by accident in front of the
hhome of a prominent citizen of this
city. The Frenchman had heard that
this gentleman had in his possession
a marvellous collection of trophies.
The fact that he had a typewriter
in his arms meant nothing to him.
He rushed up the steps and entered
the house and was on the verge of
entering the gentleman's library when
a lady appeared from a side room
much to his consternation.

Here thought the quick thinking
powers that the French race are
reputed to have stood with him.
With the utmost calm he asked the
lady, ‘‘Pardon me but is this not my
home?” \ The lady of course horrified
at the sight of him, replied in the
negative and our worthy president
beat a quick retreat.

To Bring You Higher Grades

Due to Double Ink Capacity and

FULL-LENGTH Visible Ink Supply,

it shows DAYS AHEAD when it’s

running low—ends pen failure
in Classes and Exams

A college professor noticed that
poor grades are often due not to brains
running low but to pens running dry!

So he worked out an utterly different and basically better pen principle
—and Geo. S. Parker engineered it to
perfection.

Thus came the revolutionary Parker
sacless Vacumatie that has superseded every old-style pen both sactype and sacless. See what this has
done—

Recently the student editors of 30
college papers asked 4,699 of their
readers, “Which make of pen do you
own? Which pen do you prefer?”

To both questions more students
answered “Parker,” than named any

other two makes of pens COMBINED!

One reason is that the Vacumatic
ink supply is EVER-VISIBLE, the
Full length of the barrel. It isn’t
merely last-drop visibility—doesn’t
merely show when your pen is em ty.
{t shows days ahead WHEN rs
RUNNING LOW, so it can’t run
dry against your will.

Another big reason is the patented
Parker filler. ‘This requires no sliding

pets the last week of | pre-season
training in preparation for the first
_ game of the 1936 season. The opening
game looms as'a severe engagement
and a true test of the Dalhousie
strength. ;

At present there is little chance of
even hoping» to forecast the probable
line-up for the first game. The struggle
or position is more keen this year
than perhaps ever before due to the
berths left open by the absence of
Allie McSween, Percy Sheppard, George
Thompson and Maurie Laurence.

~ Nevertheless the football material is
extremely encouraging with old veterans like Hazen Mitchell, Jack Buckley,
Henry Ross, Doug Crease, Carl Stoddard, and Squank Douggan, the stabilizing factor for the three quarter line,
boasting years of experience and
invaluable judgment.

It is recalled that the Dal scrum
has become quite famous: the result
of the severe pounding given Acadia
last year on that memorable rainy
Saturday afternoon in Wolfville. With
Pat Gunter, [ke Mercer, Pooh Dewolfe,

and Bill Cook, as a nucleus a strong
forward line is almost a certainty.

Coach Fletcher has been working
the boys up at Studley for the past
two weeks and feels now that the
team is shaping up very well, the
days of gruelling condition are about
over to be replaced by daily training
in football tactics, scrimmages and

Holders of the intercollegiate tennis

Dalhousie tennis team has already
commenced preparations in defence
of the title.

The first tryout took place at the

Roland Keddy, Frank Kenney, Bob

that there is sufficient new material
to once again retain the title of Maritime Champs.

Everyone who can hold a racket
