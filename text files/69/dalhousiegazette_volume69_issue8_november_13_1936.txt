“CALEDONIA NEXT” - CRY CITY CHAMPIONS

 

Tributes Paid
Dal Ruggers

Prof. James MacDonald _ (Tiger
Coach):

“Tf the team had exhibited the same
spirit all season as in the last few games
there would have been no need of a
play-off. I’ve thoroughly enjoyed
working with the boys. I’ve never
worked with a finer bunch of fellows
and a more cooperative group and I
certainly appreciate it. They have
kept in good condition. It looks like a
return to the.football days of several
years ago. There is one man especially
whom I would like to thank and that
is Edward Barnhill, Pres. of D. A.
A. C,, who has not missed a practice
all year. ”’

Dr. Fergie Little (Capt. Dal
1914)

“Tt was a wonderful game to watch
with the play surging from end to end.
Dal has the best scrum in the league
and the backs played their best game
of the year being very effective. I
would say it was one of the best games
I’ve ever watched and the better team
won,”

team

Dr. George Macintosh (former Dal
athlete):

“Victory is sweet at’ any time but
that last minute comeback staged on
Wednesday against a nasty 5 point
lead in the dying moments of the second half made the win doubly succulent.”

Major J.W. Logan (Member Board
of Governors and former Dal players):

“As an old Dalhousian and as an
old Dal player it is a great pleasure to
see how the team came forward and
how it weathered the storm and unfavorable conditions at first of the year, . It
is a great delight#t.me.”’

Toby Beeber:

“Tt was the boots that
I am proud of my- boys.’

Captain Pat Gunter: "The old
Tiger spirit 1s back. The boys will do
their best against. Caledonia. Win ‘or
lose Dalhousie will have nothing to be
ashamed ofelt

Prof. Fletcher, coach: “A keen,
hardworking, clean-playing team who
deserved #6 win. Keenness, fighting
spirit and the will to win countéd»more
than the superior experience and. heavier

, calibre of the Wanderers players.
They have been a delightful team to
work with during theayliole of the season.”

 

Acadia Trounced

It is just as well for Acadia that Dalhousie is not in theintercollegiate football league as the onrushing Gold and
Black tidalwave swept’into the land
of Evangelines Sattirday to administer
a 6-3 defedt to the Maritime intercollegiate champions. It was Acadia’s
second loss of the season to a Tiger
team fighting against elimination. Two
great teams met in a colorful game—
many ardent Dal supporters went by
car and bus—two bands and two sets of
cheerleaders—the fight for the Dal
dummy—a delightful tea dance.
Neither team gave an inch and the
battle continually surged from one
end of the field to the other—the difference between the two games being a
penalty goal.

Traffic Suffers
Snake Dance

 

Sleepy Halifax streets were awakened
last Wednesday afternoon to a sight
which they have not seen for at least
six .yéars. “Directly after the goalpost tearing escapade a bunch of the
boys got upan old-fashioned snake-dance;
Led by the Dal band; over four hundred students swung sinuously in single
file all over town for over two hours.

War-whooping,. . yelling, © singing,
shouting, mob spirit tooka firm hold
and swept the crowd from the Wanderers’ grounds along South Park St.
to Spring » Garden “Rd.,» where by
Bobby Burns the band serenaded the
startled Haligonians thereabouts. Then
the word got about that one of\the students, had been arrested for tearing
down the Reds’ goal uprights, The
crowd then was enthusiastic for a\rescue, eager to storm the Halifax Bastille,
mob both the police force, and release
their comrade..The Tiger fans immediately surged down Spring Garden
Rd, band leading, blocking all traffie, and pulling off street car trolleys,
yet doing no wilful destruction. When
the Patade was reached wiser heads
persuaded: the leaders that the student
arrested had been released. The boys
then marched to the Star and“Herald
offices and. to the Capitol, where in
each case they informed all and sundry
voeiferously of the score.

Up Spring Garden Rd, again, through
one door of the Lord Nelson and out
the other—up to Shirreff Hall to serenade the co-eds and inside and around
that sanctum—ending up about seven

at President Stanley’s home.

© The Tigers, still the under-dog, went

on to play a tie-game with the city
entry and journeyed to Wolfville to
set.back Acadia 6-3.

Then came the game of the Centuries.
Well, well, so they said it couldn't be
done! It looked as. if the Redmen
were going to make a slugfest of Wednesday’s epic, but the Tigers fooled
them kicked them all over the field,
and trounced them by good clean
football,

Who..can forget little Bus Phillips

the Tigérs:-can't take it, eh?, “The
Wanderers, strange to say went biblical
on us—‘‘And a. little child shall lead
them’’; a little kid from the audiencé
presented them their second try on a
silver platter. Well, Dal ruggers, we
hepe you é€njoy the reservations the
Wanderers made a little prematurely
at Glace Bay.

It seemed as though Dal was\playing

its last game of the 1936 season. Tige
ers at bay ate always dangerous,

This was seém when with but eight
minutes Of play, remaining the collegians tied the score to raise to fever
pitch excitement, in. the Dal stands.
Two minutes to. go—another try—the
game was won—-Hurrah for Dal!

It waseavtrue college day and a day
of remenibrance.. What, our frenzied
mob of Students did ‘to Wanderers’
goal posts and to’ the city after the
game only showed in small measure
the gratitude to a fighting and inspired
rugby squad. They took the red out
of Redland and painted the town with
it.

Yeah verily! That was Dalhousie’s

day, and a victory of good clean football!

Law Society

A small number of law students met
in the Moot Court Room last Monday
noon to hear the report of the committee in charge of the Law Ball.
The committee reported that a substantial profit had been made on that
gala affair, A motion commending
the efforts of the dance committee was
passed.

Edward Byrne sprang some _fireworks by suggesting that the Gazette
bill for advertising be not paid, because of misrepresentation as regards
cost, and because of an _ editorial,
“Merely Money,” which appeared on
‘behalf of cheaper dances just prior
to the Law Dance and which was alleged to be such adverse advertising
that the advertising contracted for
was nullified. No definite action was
taken on this suggestion. After much

Agains Birth Control.

To Editor of the Gazette.

 
 

Dear Sir:—

In the~ Gazette of October 30th,
there appeared under the title ‘‘Something to Think About" several paragraphs which read so like a defence
ef birth control that on social and
economic grounds alone they should
not go unanswered.

Although this subject involves in
its very essence grave moral considerations which far outweigh in importance any material ones, be they
individual or social; yet on the basis
of economic argument attention may
be drawn to the proceedings of the
British Association this autumn, In
his presidential address to this year's
conference Sir Josiah Stamp proclaimed
with all possible emphasis that birth
control—far from being a cure for
unemployment and poverty—has already created a problem which will
eclipse all other problems of national
welfare in the years to come, The
birth rate in England is steadily declining and within a very few years
the population will have become
stationary and will thereafter shrink
with increasing rapidity. In his masterly analysis of the effects of this
situation Sir Josiah points out two
grave problems which must be faced
without delay, The first is that
more unemployment is inevitable if
machines continue to displace labour
while the number of coasumers begins
to diminish. The second is that the
population contains an abnormal and
growing proportion of old people who
consume less than the young. The
writer of last week’s article accuses the
law of “deliberately fostering ignorance’ by its efforts to prevent a
similar situation in Canada.

In referring to the court case which
he discusses the writer omits to mention the fact that it was brought out
in the evidence that birth control
information was being disseminated
aot alone to the destitute married
but also to unmarried girls. This
is an aspect of birth control that
must be faced by its proponents,

   

Sincerely yours,
Anonymous.

November, 13th., 1936

 

The remarkably short time required
by the New York reporters to encircle
the globe has added fresh impetus to
the usual theme of the gentlemen who
write the editorials for the daily newspapers. This event provided a new
reason for their laudatory extolling
of the wonders of modern progress.

Yet when one considers the spheres
in which the greatest advancements
have been made by the modern world
one cannot help but be astounded at
the singularly one sided aspect of this
progress. In the mechanical sphere
we have indeed achieved wonders but
in. the cultural economic and _ social
spheres we are virtually living in a
dark age.

In the economic sphere one sees
manufactured products heaped up in
the warehouses because there is no
market for them, products of the farm
being sold, if at all, at a loss, the fishermen destroying a large part of their
catch, millions of capable able bodied
men willing to work but denied that
right, starvation and destitution in the
midst of an abundance of materiaj
goods. Yet when the problem is
stated, it is the more tantalizing because of its apparent simplicity. The
farmers have produced more farming
products than they require for their
own immediate wants and are willing
to trade off the surplus for the manufactured goods they require. Those
engaged in the manufacturing of goods
ure willing to trade their surplus for the
products of the farm. Lawyers, doctors, labourers and engineers are willing to exchange their services for a
part of this surplus of manufactured
and farming materials. So the only
problem is to see that this exchange
takes place. Yet the abstruse volumes
on economic and political science have
failed to provide the solution to a
problem that would seem more ap
| propriate on the page of a child’s prim
er. At present we seem to be moving
from this cycle of depression to one of
prosperity, but without a guarantee

that we may not again have a similar
period - of depression.

We have _har
 

nessed the forces of nature but we are
still the slaves of economic laws.

Our engineers with unsurpassable
ingenuity and skill have constructed
intricate radio stations and receiving
sets. The human voice and picture
can be transmitted from one end of
the earth to the other. But why?
In order that some black faced com.
edian might tell the latest joke about
Rastus or that some raucous announcer might extoll the merits of the latest
corn-remover? Technicians have harnessed the forces of light and sound
that a slovenly, obese woman
glorify the prostitute. Chemists hay:
evolved new theories of the constityents of the elements with the result
that poisonous gases will produce more
destruction in the next world slaughter,

It is indeed about time that we declared a moratorium on mechanical
development and thus enabled social,
cultural and economic development
to catch up. It can be truly said that
in the mechanical sphere we are in the
airplane stage, in the cultural sphere
wé are in the ox-cart stage.

Students Chosen

Sodales Debating Society held trials
lately in the Moot Court Room to
select a team of debaters to oppose the
representatives of St. John Law School

in John, N. B. The debate is
scheduled for the 20th of this month
and the resolution: that the modern

trend of democratic government toward Bureaucracy is a favorable, one

furnishes good material for discussion.

Messrs. Babbitt Parlee, Moncton,
second year Law man, is the leader of
the team while Rowan Colemén.

Montreal, first year Law is to uphold
his arguments. Jud
were Dean V. C. MacDonald, Profs.,
Curtis and Willis. Sodales is confident
in its team and expects it to bring back
the laurels again this year.

’

_. During the war of 1812 an expedition
pa eet out from Halifax and succeeded in
_ capturing Castine, a small town on

1 a the coast of Maine, and took possession

aot - the surrounding country. This

_ town was made the only port of entry

for the newly acquired British territory

: Stand there a customs “office was set up

_ to collect duties. In the seven months

of occupation these duties collected

amounted to over £11,500, and when

a ' the English evacuated Castine in

cs _ April 1815, this sum was brought to

a Halifax and the Secretary of State

for the Colonies directed that this

“Castine Fund” be used for improve
ments in Nova Scotia.

_ Nova Scotia. He was our founder,

tablets of s! stondt bearing a, Latin in: os scription telling when the building
was begun and finished. (A picture
of this building appeared in the Hatifax
Herald, November 2, 1936).

Sir James Kempt who was a staunch
-.- supporter of the new college and it
x was through his efforts that funds
were secured to complete the building.
In 1821 the College was incorporated
by the Local Legislature after receiving
approval of the Colenial Secretary.
Both King’s College, at Windsor, and
Pictou Academy were established before
Dalhousie. These were religious institutions, King’sibeing Anglican, waile
the .promoters of Pictou Academy
~ were Presbyterians, Lord Dalhousie
intended that the college at Halifax
should be non-sectarian and ‘open
 toall who profess the Christian religion;
' the youth of His Majesty's North
American Colonies, to strangers residing
here, to gentlemen of the military as
‘well as the learned professions, to all,
in short, who may be disposed to
devote a small part of their time to
study.”
Owing to financial difficulties the
college did not begin operations until
1888 when an affiliation with Pictou
Academy was effected.
Many attempts were made to unite
-_ with King’s College but these were all
frustrated by the Governor of King’s
| whe listed fourteen objections. Among
these was that ‘This University (i. e
| Kings) is placed in a retired part of the
: ae _ kingdom, where its professors, fellows,
— and students enjoy learned leisure
a : with dignity, and pursue and perfect
their studies undisturbed by a noisy
a populace—the hurry and bustle of
_ trade—and the dissipation, extra-vag, “ances, and bad example of the idle,
etc.’ In the meantime the building
was used as the studio of a painting
_elub, and, in 1834, as a cholera hospital.
a In 1828 the Legislature voted £5000
a asa loan to’ Dalhousie to be paid back
in five years. Needless to say under
- the conditions which then existed it
was impossible to repay this loan
shtonch many in the House of Assemo. were in favor of enforcing its
collection. However, in 1829, they
agreed to ‘give the college three more

Edward Barnhill:—Pres. of the
1D, A. A, C. and Fourth Year Medical
Student.

‘“Barney"’ as he is affectionately
called, received his early education in
Bayfield, N. B. and then proceeded
to Mt. Allison Academy and University where he completed his Pre-medical course.

While at Mt. Allison he was President of the Sophomore Class and a
member of the Finance Committee, a
body similar in function to the D. A.
AziG,:

This year sees him as D. A. A.C.
President for the second term and also
President of the Phi Rho Sigma.

Upon his arrival at Dafhousie to
enter Medicine the story is told that
one of his professors immediately
classified him as a person that the world
would never disturb nor hurry. And
such has been the case for during the
time that he has held one of the most
responsible offices on the campus,
he has never been known to lose his
outward calm appearance.

During his term of office Barnhill has
given unselfishly of his time and energy and the efficiency of that body
is in no small part due to his efforts.

EDWARD BARNHILL

His latest bid to fame is the satisfactory settlement of the Dal-Wanderers Football Protest. How he accomplished it is hard to understand,
but on behalf of the Rugby Team and
its supporters we say, “Thank you.”

In 1830 the Governors wrote to
Dr. Memes of Ayr offering him the
situation of Principal with a salary
of £300 exclusive of class fees, which
he accepted. It was also the intention
of the Governors to associate with
him the Rev. Thomas Aitkin, who at
this time was teaching a private school
of an advanced kind within the college
building. Just what happened is not
clear, but it is certain that Dr. Memes
never began his duties as principal.

Imperialist Propagands?

Quebec: It is time to ask what
success has been achieved by the very
honorable ‘lords’ who visited Canada
during the last few months with the
object of spreading imperialist propaganda. The result of the following
debated reperted in the Queen’s Journal
may be significant. The subject was:
“Resolved that this house approves
the attitude of the Canadian Prime
Minister at Geneva.’’ (We recall that
this attitude was sharply Canadian
and certainly not very British). Now,
after the debate, ‘the numerous audience rejected the resolution by a
‘substantial majority,” saysthe Journal.

The following pitiful plea comes from
a columnist in the Queen’s Journal:

“Hoping that this year’s executive
will stir itself into doing something
really constructive, may we call attention to the horrible and nauseating
odour in the east entrance of the
Douglas Library. The Journal pointed
out last year that something must
have died there but as yet the carcass
has not been removed. In its present
state of decomposition, its aroma
defies description.”

Some Sidelights
On Socialites

The Dalhousie Tiger football team

were on the proverbial spot when they

took the field against Acadia Saturday. With the matter of the protest
still in the air those officials of the
D. A. A. C. who were behind the protest would have appeared rather
foolish had not the Tigers defeated
Acadia. However, their charges came
through in a great big way, in spite of a
series of injuries, in spite of darkness
and in spite of what hung in the balance.

As to the Cubs they also deserve to
be commended. Perhaps they were
not exactly up to the mark but it must
be remembered that in order to provide
the senior team with material they
have bled most profusely.

The morning before the Freshman
Glee Club presentation made its debut
it looked as if officials of the organization had built a Frankenstein that
could not be put into operation. But
the success of the presentation proved
most conclusively that anything can
happen in aday. Special credit for the
success we feel is due Bud MacDougall
and Maud Inness. Thus marks the
first bid of class ‘40 towards glory in
the land of Dal.

It was rather doubtful whether
Scrapper Moss was playing, refereeing

‘or merely an over enthusiastic spec
}

te ne mm

tator at Acadia Saturday. Showing
evidence of a powerful Dalhousie spirit
we feel confident he was capable of
punching his way out of a paper bag.

As dusk shadows fell and spectators,
tired after a series of lengthy time outs,
gradually filed out of the covered stand,
romance at football games appeared
in an entirely new fashion. Three
couples perfectly satisfied with the
GAME and snuggled under the surplus of rugs stayed on and on and on,
The Sigma Chi’s feel confident that
football under floodlights would go
over provided there was no light in the
stands. What about it Simpson, Hurst,
and Sterns?

Why did Fran Drummie blush so
fetchingly when she sold a poppy to
the campus Hero. ‘‘M’Gawd you've
got appeal.”’

Where was the renowned Rowley
discrimination at the last Glee Club
Show. Perhaps it is true that gentlemen do prefer blondes. Apparently
the Council makes rules and Rowley
breaks them.

Overheard at Sigma Chi at the Mothers’ Tea Sunday afternoon. Wink
Johnston “If Vic Kyte and Boyd MacGillivray could only see me on this
verandah with a lady, holding a tea
cup in my hand and my little finger
thumbing a ride.”

Nasty! Nasty! Dal Co-ed’s now walk
home. Perhaps the Misses Holman,
Finlayson and Geldert will henceforth
earry BLUE JAYS with them.

What do Co-ed’s get from sororities
inquiries the Studley Story. Can it
be that this is sour grapes? In as
much that the author has never had
the opportunity to bite a piece out of
any Co-ed’s forehead at a Sorority
dance.

We see that Prof. William Scott’s
class in Nektique has been taken over
by Dr. Wally Roy. All applicants
apply back stage. While speaking of
the Glee Club we understad that Jeff
Marshall is still coaching the new play
despite the efforts of Phil Stein,

We would really like to know what
powers Murray Gould possesses, we are
told he dated a frail for 8 o’clock and
called at 11.15—And what is more she
went. Shades of Bill Simpson. And
speaking of Simpson can it be that the
atmosphere of the Ladies’ College is
improving him.

Can it be that the very quiet and
dignified Phi Kapp Halloween party
had its after effects. We noticed very
few of them at Wolfville.

“Two bits” isn’t much to pay for a
car, but from authoritative sources we
learn that the junk heap moved fast
enough to ruffle family feeling. Scrapper’s hair and Evatt’s pants, but the
suave Mr. Meagher took his beating
with a grin. Yeah verily, there is a
special providence.

If Bedford and Dartmouth ever get
to-gether and compare fraternity pins
Birks will lose their best customer in
the person of Scotty Montgomerie.

Now we've all heard the story of
sipping cider through a straw. Evidently BUTCH Arnell—Caw-staihs to
you—has learned to put straws to a
better advantage. Was that some of
Roy’s special vintage you had at Acadia,
Butch?

Glee Club

The annual Frosh Glee Club Show
has as its professed object the unearthing of talent—if such there be—
among the newcomers to the University. From this angle and from the
angle of pure entertainment, last

- week's presentation was quite success
ful, but with the exception of one or
two notable moments it was far from
art.

The Frosh themselves, for the most
part, carried off their end of the performance quite well, but whether
from bad management or a complete
lack of management, the technical
and stage effects were really almost
pitiful. A spotlight in front of a gauze
curtain that showed up every seam and
thread and took most of the fantasy
out of the Prologue; blackouts that
weren't blackouts that brought hoots

from the audience; crooked curtains

and mysterious hands that waved from

the wings; too much light on “The

Way You Look Tonight’’ which made

en i just another song out of a potentially
beautiful scene; not enough light on

a the piano solo which left a_ restless

+

 

audience waiting for something to

happen; a midnight chime that sound
ed like Major’s Bowe’s gong; a Fairy

Queen left stranded on the stage waving her wand and praying for results—
all these added but little to the show.
His record of many Glee Club successes in the past are quite sufficient
evidence thut these errors can not be
blamed on Mr. J. P. Connolly and it is
certain that his part in the production
of the show received the full benefit of
his very considerable stage experience.
All the more credit, then, to the
people who made the night good entertainment. In particular, THE
GAZETTE awards the Palm..To
Maud Inness for a truly charming
“Cinderella.” Her stage appearance,
voice, grace of movement and restraint
of acting, gave high promise of at
least a GLEE CLUB future. To Bud
MacDougall, whose pleasing baritone
voice and balanced appreciation. of
romance and comedy added so much

(Continued,from page 2)

The story in 1940 may be a different
one. In fact eight years in the minds
of most electors is long enough. So,
Mr. Roosevelt, why not forget patronage and give America a new political term. The lives of not only 120
million Americans are in your hands
but an anxious world too will feel the
repercussions of your acts. America
is isolationist only in name.

If you have a sense of humour, Mr.
Koosevelt, and we believe you have,
why not subscribe to the Literary Digest? They must need support now.
Speaking of the failure of their forecast,
it in our opinion shews two things.
Firstly; that
election are similar to those about a

prognostications of an

horse. race—everyone’s guess is as
good as the others. Secondly; that a
sampling of the class of people that
read the Literary Digest is only a smal]
portion of the voting eligibles. The
inarticulate masses may not speak in a
straw vote or through the controlled
press, but in the polling booth Democracy gives them the unbridled
right of speaking as they wish. When
the forces of American “Big Business”

are opposed to them they speak in one
voice. We now know how large that
voice is. Stupid Republican managers
didn’t see this. Perhaps they did, but
also thought that the riches of the business lords would offset it. Congratulations, Democracy, in your victory over
money power,

play.
