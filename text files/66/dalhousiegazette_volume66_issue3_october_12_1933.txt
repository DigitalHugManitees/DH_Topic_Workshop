Students

Urges Interest In
Campus Activities

———— ————

Our community of interests,
here at Dalhousie University,

might be greatly advanced by

the students taking a more
lively interest in the different
student organizations, such as
the Dalhousie Gazette, Sodales
Debating Club, and the Glee
and Dramatic Club. Such was
the excellent advice given to
Dalhousie students by Dr. Carleton W. Stanley, President of the
University, in an address delivered to the student body, in the
Gymnasium last ‘Thursday
morning.
President Stanley opened his
address by welcoming the students back to the University
for the winter's work. He then
paid high tribute to the memory
of Dr. MacMechan, who was
for many years a Professor of
English in this University. He
declared that all those who had
associated with Dr. MacMechan
in any way had been immeasurably enriched by this association,
and that the University as a
whole had suffered a great loss
in his untimely denth.
_ Entering a University means
more than gaining advantages
for oneself, the President stated,
it means the taking on of certain

tions to our fellow

~

fists obt

     

the University for the first time,
declaring that they were entering a society as rich in opportunity as any to be found. Dalhousie has been famed for the
type of men who have graduated
from her class rooms.

Dr. Stanley urged the stu
dents, who were entering the
University for the first time, to
strive to carry on the already
rich and romantic tradition of
the University, during their stay
at Dalhousie. The President
then drew attention to the
terrible catastrophy that has
overtaken intellectual learning
in Germany, where many of the
most valuable intellectual documents have been destroyed by
the Nazis within the past year or
sO.
_ What has happened in Germany is a powerftil threat to
intellectual training the world
over, the President declared.
Nothing like the burning of the
manuscripts in Germany, has
taken place in civilized countries
for centuries, and it should be
viewed with considerable alarm
by people the World over.

Sodales will hold its first
meeting and debate of
the season on Tuesday
evening, October 17th.
The debate will be of
special interest to Freshmen, as members of their
class will be represented.
Following the debate
there will be discussion
from the floor. A warm
welcome is extended to
all new students to present their views at Sodales for the first time.
Come prepared to take
part in the activities and
help us to make this an

- outstanding year in de

With the passing of the old

tar-and-feather type of initiation, the students of King’s have
adopted a new way of formally
greeting the freshmen.

The occasion was on Thursday night, Oct. 5th, and the
general feeling was that the
ceremonies were really more beneficial and interesting than the
old-time hazing.

_ To begin with the frosh entertained their seniors with bits
of plays and songs. Their attempts of course, were met with
appropriate comments from the
heartless audience. Then, with
due decorum and an impressive
procession the ‘Freshman ‘Litany’ was made known to them.

Following this, two events of
greai interest to freshmen and
seniors alike took place and
then the entire student body
assembled in the Haliburton
Room. A most enjoyable array
of refreshments was supplied by
the frosh and disposed of bv
everyone. Songs were sung and
individua's entertained around
the blazing fire. When the gathering broke up, about 12.80, it
was with a feeling of satisfaction
for the seniors and of pleasure
for the freshman that initiation
could be carried out with such
friendliness.

The committee of the FreshieSoph dance is striving to make
this affair novel in every respect.
The dance is scheduled for
Thursday, October 12th, and
the students are showing interest
to such an extent that the function is bound to be a success.
Jerry Naugler and his orchestra
are to provide the music.

At their first meeting of the
term, the Quinctilian Society of
King’s decided to turn al] their
efforts into producing another
Mock Parliament. This event
has always been one of the highlights of the term and the Society
expects to stir up a lot of excitement as soon as the party leaders
set themselves up for the election.

The names of those men elected to presidentship of their respective classes have been ratified by the entire student body.
D. Morris is head of the Seniors,
J. Gladwin of the Juniors, W.

Important Matters

 

The Council of the Students
met in the Munro Room at 7.30
p. m. on Tuesday evening, with
the President, Mr. Wigmore, in
the chair.

After the minutes were read
and approved, the Council proceeded with plans for the Annual
Students’ Council Dance. Mr.
Thompson reported for the committee consisting of himself, Mr.
Brody, and Miss Atherton, on
the respective merits of a dance
in the Gymnasium and one in a
hotel. After a lengthy discussion, the Council voted to hold
the Dance in the Gymnasium on
the evening of Monday, October
16th, at 8 o'clock. The members of the Council, in making
this decision, felt that they were

jacting in the best interests of

the whole Student Body.

Suggestions from the retiring
President of the Glee Club re
changes in the organization were
deferred for full consideration
after the new officers are elected.

At the request of Mr. Bent,
Interfaculty Manager, the Council voted to ask the Senate to
postpone the half-holiday for
track and field sports from
Thursday of this week until
Thursday of next or the following week.

Mr. Squire appeared before
the Council and presented a
very strong plea for support for
the Soccer Team and, on his
request, the Council granted
$45.00 to this branch of sport.

F. C. Payne (Red) was appointed Property Manager of

The first smoker of the season
was held by the Dalhousie Unit
of the C. O. T. C., in the Munro
Room, at Forrest Hall, last
Wednesday evening. The function was very largely attended,
there being about sixty present
and the meeting was presided
over by Captain Douglas, Officer Commanding of the Unit.

Captain Douglns spoke briefly,
mainly upon matters of organization. He was followed by Prof.
A. K. Griffin, who announced
the results of the examinations
held in the Unit last Spring.
He also announced that a camp
would be held fbr the Unit, on
MacNab’s Island, October 13th,
14th. and 15th.

The prineipal speaker of the
evening was Major Cock, Officer
Commanding of the R. C. R. in
Halifax, who spoke on “The
Aims and, Ideals of the O. T. C.”’
His address was very interesting
and instructive and was much
enjoyed by the boys.

Mr. Beveridge and Mr. Egan
rendered several musical selections that were much enjoyed
by those present, and Sergeant
Major Hill, R. C. R., gave a
recitation. Refreshments were
served during the evening.

On suggestion of Mr. Thompson, the Council decided to
adopt the following Bye-Laws:

(1) That regular meetings of
the Council be held at stated
intervals.

(2) That all budgets be presented by an executive, in person, of the society or organization in whose interests it is presented.

(3) That the Freshman Representative in any year be CoTreasurer of the Freshman Class
in that year, and that he served
as Financial Adviser.

The Council decided that an
official report of the meetings of
the Council should be prepared
by the Secretary of the Council
for publication in the Gazette
antl local press. Further that
this is the first official report of
the Council of Students.

The Council considered the
recommendations submitted by
the joint committee, representing Dalhousie Council and the
King’s Council, appointed last
year to recommend revisions of
the then-existing agreement between these bodies. These were
passed on to a committee for
presentation to the King’s Council,

On motion, the meeting adjourned. |

The chief function of the
Student Christian Movement is
to conduct study groups of a
religious character, dealing especially with the records of the
life and teachings of Jesus. Last
year the following groups were
organized by the movement at
Dalhousie: “A Study of Jesus
in the Records’, consisting of
three groups led by Dr. Bronson
which will be reorganized in the
coming year; ‘‘Christianity and
International Problems’’ by Dr.
McKay; ‘‘Re-thinking Missions’’
Mrs. E. W. Nichols; and ‘‘Christianity and Social Problems’’ by
Professor Walker.

Topics for this year have been
suggested and leaders are possible for the following groups:
“International Problems’’: ‘‘Science and Religion’, (Does Science abolish God?); ‘‘Jesus in the
Records’’, (A scientific effort to
discover the real Jesus); ‘‘Practicability of Jesus’ Principles in
Modern Science’’; ‘“‘Is Our Economic Order Essentially Unchristian?’’; ““The Four Absolutes of the Oxford Group Movement’; “Phychology and the
Idea of God’’; “The Gospel of
St. John”; ‘Missionary Problems’; ‘“‘The Criminal and Society’’; “The Future University’’;
“Religion and Education.’,

Students interested in any of
these study groups should make
arrangements with one of the
following: Bill Archibald, Doug
Allen, Grace Baird, May Burgess
Jean Crowdis, Ena Marber, Eirene Walker, Harold Wright,
Wendell Hewson, Neil Higgins,
Tom Mitchell, Kay Moxon, Walter Mutch, Mona Strum, Roy
Webster, Daisy Zwicker.

The Dalhousie
Book Club

 

 

The attention of members of
the University is called to the
Book Club, which is housed in
the Gymnasium Building.
Scores of new books have been
recently added, and there are
now several hundred volumes
available. These consist of recently published books in biography, travel, essays and belles
lettres, art, science, politics, economics, history, etc. A partial
list of new arrivals in the Club
since June 1988 is given below,
and many others have arrived
since this list was made.

The Book Club was initiated
last November, and members
who joined then are not obliged
to renew subscriptions until next
month. At that time all the
books which have been in the
Book Club for a year will be
moved into the main University
Library, to make way for the
new volumes, which are steadily
being added to the shelves of the
Book Club.

Meantime new subscribers are
invited to join the Club. All
moneys coming in from _ subscriptions will immediately be
turned into new books. The

annual fee is $5.00 (undergraduates $3.00).

number of Dalhousie students
enjoyed a showing of Jack Hulbert in “‘Love on Wheels’’, as
guests of Mr. R. J. Macadam,
proprietor of the Casino Theatre.
This is but one of the many
courtesies Mr. Macadam has
extended to the students. The
show was thoroughly enjoyed
by all who attended.

Wining Try In Last
Minute of Play

In a fast wide-open game
which provided plenty of thrills
for the spectators the Dalhousie
Tigers came from behind in the
last thirty seconds of play to
triumph over Acadia by a score
of 11 to 9 on Thanksgiving Day
at Wolfville. This marks the
first time since 1928 that the
Bengals have taken the Garnet
and Blue into camp on Acadia
grounds.

In the first period, Tedford of
Acadia opened the scoring by
booting a penalty kick over the
bar from a difficult angle. This
aroused the Bengals who after a
snappy running play placed the
oval across the line (Murray
from Darrow). Connor converted to make the tally 5-3.
Shortly after this Acadia’s
wing _ three-quarter,
Fountain, scored but the try
Was not converted. At half
time the score read 6 to 5 in
favor of Acadia. About midway in this session, Wilson of
Acadia met with a painful injury,
a fractured kneecap, leaving his
team one man_ short. Both
teams lost a man when Reéferee
Fletcher Smith banished Connor, Dal fullback, and Stanfield,
Acadia centre back, for rough
play.

Upon sesuming the match,
play see-sawed back and forth
until Armstrong planted the pigskin between the posts for Acadia. Although square in front
of the bar the kick for extra
points was unsuccessful. Oyler
broke into the scoring column
for Dal when he made good a
penalty kick thirty yards out,
bringing the score to 8-9. Dal
fought gamely, but could not
Make-up that lone point, until
in the last minute of play Dal
rushed the ball down the field
as far as Acadia’s five yard line.
A melee ensued in which Bud
Peters grabbed the oval and

charged across the line. The
attempt to convert failed. The
whistle ended the game. Score:

Dal 11; Acadia 9.

The Acadia scrum held the
edge over their lighter rivals,
but the Dal backfield had more
punch than Acadia’s. Credit
for the victory goes to Coach
McCarthy for it was his plays
that brought the team through.
It would be difficult to pick
stars from Dal’s lineup because
all the boys played a whale of a

game and are ready for the
Wanderers on Saturday.

THE success of this year’s initiation program at Dalhousie
* augurs well for the repetition of a similar proceeding in the
__—- years to come. Horseplay and the rough-and-tumble have been
thrown to the limbo of forgotten things that a saner and more
_ dignified introduction to college life may rule in their stead. It is
unthinkable that anyone, save he who has an axe to grind, can
regret the passing of the diverting but dangerous procedure of the
old days. The new era has come to Dalhousie by a process of
— gradual revolution. In 1927 the sanguinary free-for-all passed
~ from the scene and was replaced by ‘organized hazing’, a plan by
vhich a reasonable and equitable amount of abuse was to be handed
ek Out to each and every member of the new Class. The scheme had
2 merit if you accept the theory of hazing. But in this University it
failed of its purpuse through two circumstances, the numerical
weakness of the Sophomore year and the failure of upperclassmen
_ to assist in the enforcement of rules. Organized hazing became a
~ farce. Where the official system failed a few benighted souls

two dignitaries who in particular have a difficult time of it. The

some former years. That there should be any noticeable decline
js regrettable. The blame for such decline is not to be laid at the
doors of former officers. They have, for the most part, laboured
with diligence and ability. The decline has occurred in spite

and not because, of their efforts. Rather it is to be attributed to
- that same invidious inertia of the students which is every year

damned editorially as a matter of course. Glee Club has an
appreciative audience but few willing entertainers. Sodales uncovers a number of good speakers but is handicapped by the lack

See Pige Most of the people who have just come—or come back—to

a time for the dreaming of dreams and the resolving of good resolutions and the planning of campaigns. The little world is full of
the things that are going to be done in the way of campus careers.

The Freshman exudes enthusiasm, the Senior makes a stab at

We take issue with a columnist in the last Gazette upon the
value of specialization in college
work. “O passi graviora’’, how
times have changed since Bacon
said, “I take all knowledge to
be my province,’ Now the spec
ialist and alleged expert spends

his years contemplating through
a microscope the incrustations
upon the leg of a flea and speculating upon their cosmic significance. This tendency towards
wholesale specialization is dangerously restrictive; it crams a
student’s head full of information about one subject, but
leaves him in ignorance of ail
else. This chaos of accumulated
facts would form a series of
arches without a single pillar;
there would be no grasp of the
unity and significance of life
which alone makes it worth
living. Now that analysis leaps
and synthesis lags, we fear the
experts in every field, and hide
ourselves in the obscurities and
abstractions of our own special
subject. As Prof. Whitehead
says in “Science and the Modern
World,” “This situation has its
dangers, it produces minds in a
groove. Each profession makes
progress, but it is progress in
its own groove....But there
is no groove which is adequate
for the comprehension of human
life."’ We lose sight of the forest
on account of the trees; only
by taking a total perspective of
knowledge can we have a full
development and gain balanced
growth of individuality which
it should be the aim of education
to secure.

 

We might suggest an improvement in the magazine section of
the library. Often a student
has a spare quarter-hour or so
which he might spend profitably
by pe.using a magazine, yet the

only mate.ial available is in the
form of abstruse mathematic, |

economic, or philosophic probJems as technically discussed in
scientific journals. In addition
to these there are several Janguage magazines and a number
of college quarterlies. A few
semi-popular and popular periodicals such as the Forum, Harpers,
Reader’s Digest, The Golden
Book, the Literary Digest, or
even MacLeans would greatly
enkance the vaJue of this paiticular department and would
lead a number of studenis to
forsake the smoking room for
the library. thus promoting more
valuable habits. The present
magazines are too profound and
too technical for cursory reading
and some lighter material for
spare moments might be appreciated.

 

Any man who has attained a
high position in life is bound to
be the subject of criticism. It
is therefore fitting, that in this
corner, there appear from time
to time, crificisms of President
Stanley.

Talking about the gymnasium
and places where the students
could mingle to swap ideas or
small talk, he said he hoped that
some day there would be, on the
campus here,a dining-hall where
male students and male professors could have lunch together.
The idea that there should be
more mixing of the students is
commendable, for in this college
of specialists, each group and
faculty belittles its neighbour.
But surely there is a better way
of bringing it about than by a
dining-hall. Such places are notorious for the poor food they
serve. No student ever went to
a college residence, fresh from
his mother’s pantry, without
bitterly complaining about the
quality and sameness of the
food. Indeed, bope of better
meals is one of the reasons why
so many residence boys join
fraternities.

No, Mr. President, we do not
want a dining-hall.
a reading and smoking room,
with enough current magazines
and newspapers to make it attractive bring the students together satisfactorily?

 

But would.

Comment

 

Many of tke students have
already begun to show their
interest in this column. Their
letters are so numerous that |
find it impossible to a nswer them
all Nevertheless, I wi!l attempt to cear them up as best
l can. This is not supposed to
be a Dorothy Dix or a W. J.
Foley sport column, because I
am going to answer the questions truthfully.

(1) Does Prof. Murray Macneill Jive in the Murray Homestead?

The answer to this is no.

(2) When da classes start?
There is no answer to this. I
advise you to take the first train
home.

(3) Does the storekeeper ever
make mistakes in changing bills
of large denomination? Answer
No, he looks too closely at the
money and if he does it wil] be
to his own advantage.

(4) Can Bob Weitz and Morty
Goldberg sing? The question
is persona’ and I refuse to answer
it.

(5) Do college students always
scratch matches on the bottom
of their shoes?

Ans.: Never, because they
usually tear their socks.

(6) Should the boys hire cars
when they take girls out?

Ans.: No, girls should be satisied with the splendid carriage
nature has given them.

(7) Dear Writer :—

I have been at college exactly
one week and so far nobody
seems to realize that I am here.
Back home I was captain of the
local footbal! team, played every
game there was to play and
knew both the girls in town by
their first names. I would like
to be a big shot at Dal as well.
Can you he!lp me?

Expectantly,
A Stude.

Answer: There seems to be no
earthly reason why you cannot
become wha t you wish. | I advise
you first of all to join the C. O.
T. C., where men are men and,
women are not present. Also
get out and play the manly
game because everyone admires
aman whocantakeit. Remember me to the boys back home.

Recently, at McGill University several students were fined
two dollars and up for initiating
freshmen. This should be sufficient warning to Dalhousians
who might attempt to haze
some unsuspecting freshmen.

The first year med class have
been having it quite easy lately
because their microscopes have
not arrived from Germany yet.
Hurrah for Hitler.

at the doors of universities particularly on this continent today is that they do not prepare
the student for life. This does
not mean that the university
courses are not practical or
utilitarian enough, for, no one
could seriously charge our educational institutions with that at
present, but that when the student has finished his course. as
practical as it may be, he is not
prepared to grapple with the
problems of life.

The student attending the
university is Offered and does
take a multitude of courses, usually joins several clubs, to give
himself an opportunity to use
his abilities and frequently participates in athletics. But he
has neglected the most important side of college life, that is
trying to understand what
college education leads to.

Unless a student takes time
out to consider his path, to endeaveur to synthesize his information and to form a working
Philosophy, he has really wasted
his time. It is not philosophy
in the sense that it is used in
expression, a philosophy of life.
[t does not mean a philosophy of
life. One does not look for that
necessarily at college although
the experiences gained there will
undoubtedly help each indiviudal to form one. It is rather
thought that is necessary—a syn‘hesizing thought, a realization
of one’s probiems and an attempt to so've them. By merely going to lectures and clubs and
by participating in athletics one
is merely passively accepting
what is offered. The student
must use what he acquires in
these activities to find out what
he wants both in college and in
life. :

_ The main constituent missing
in the student’s life is this ‘‘time
out.” The student should every
once in a while siop himself and
say “Where am I going?” ‘““‘What
are my activities giving me?”
Can I adequately from this
helter-skelter of experience, fashion out a unifying principle?”’

diseases.

These questions have to be
faced in life and if they are
realized while one is pursuing
an academic course one is all the
more prepared for life. If a
principle and a purpose can be
found in college then troubles
over what courses to take and
what clubs to join and what attitude to take to problems of
college, be no more.

Then will the student be adequately prepared for life and
armed with this he will be able
to Jook life in the face and
squeeze from it the little bit of
happiness that is sure to be his.
“Time out!’ is the answer to the
charge.— McGiul Datiy.

ACTIVE RESEARCH YIELDS
DISCOVERIES.

The encephalitis epidemic this
summer focused international
medical attention on St. Louis,
and incidentally gave Washington University Medical School
laboratories a special prominence

Research work on the disease
has been concentratéd there.
Two floors of the Dispensary
Building on Euclid Avenue are
being used for pathological and
medical investigations by whiversity and visiting scientists.
A portion of the Oscar Johnson
Institute is given over to epidemiological studies of the disease—all the investigations of
the mosquito as a possible carrier, for instance, are being done
there. Experimental animals
used in the researches, chiefly
monkeys, are quartered on the
roofs of the same two buildings.

Inclusion Bodies.

The most sensational result of
the summer’s anxiety and work
was Dr. Margaret Smith's discovery of ‘inclusion bodies’ in
the kidney cells of encephalitis
victims. Inclusion bodies are
small sac-like bodies in the cytoplasm of the cell. Their appearance varies with different
Their significance is

too bad you couldn't have extended the idea throughout the

idea that the paper belongs to
me, i. e. myself and those others
who contributed ten bucks to
public charity. This idea left
me cold until it suddenly struck
me that someone might think I
did own the paper and was
responsible in part for what was
in it. I can vision children saying “Yah” at me, dogs barking
at my heels, and respectable

The Editor,

Dal Gazette.

Sir:

In a recent issue of your publication there appeared an article
entitled “Specialization.” With
many of the views. therein expressed I find myself in happy.
One or two state
In afew
of the courses on the more exact
sciences only can the graduate
claim to be anything of an expert at the time he graduates.
In practicaJly every other course,
which purports to give the student a specialzed training, the
graduate is not fitted for practice until] he has acquired something by way of experience.
The course gives him a theoreticalfoundation. The rest he cannot learn from books, but must
dig around for himself on the
trial and error method. Now if
we are going to build a theoretical background beneaih the expert, and I suggest that is the
function of the University, we
might as well do it effectively.
We should broaden his outlook
so as to include in it an appreciation at least of the existence of
specialized fields other than his
own. So instead of cramming
him with the theory of this or
that which will occupy the rest
of his life, we insist that he look
into one or two things whose
bearing on the way he earns his
living may be remote, but whose
influence on the way he lives
and thnks may be very direct.

DALHOUSIE GAZETTE

To My Public

By DOCTOR HAMILTON

Being obligated to my old
cell-mate the editor of this venerable, publication, he has demanded from me six hundred
written words. Failure to comply means destruction of the
Doctor’s home through vitiating
his line of credit with the milkman.

Perhaps some reader pre-judging the juvenile tenor of this
column wonders how Doctor
Hamilton escapes the present
epidemic of infantum cholera.

The omniscient Doctor has
been assigned any topic or topics
from the claim to culinary fame
of a chinese sandwich :which
for the benefit of my intelligent
and cultured readers is an owl’s
hoot between two tea leaves;
to an inquiry as to just what
was between John Smith and
Pocohontus.

The editor, realizing the Doctor’s propensity for telling the
truth, warns him to avoid contentious topics, because a libel
charge is aninconvenience. But
who wants to court such a possibility ? Who wishes extra
work on our ‘‘gentleman of the
jury’’, our sheriffs, lawyers, and
our judges who, being ‘ ‘human
and humane” like Doctor Hamilton dislike unnecessary work
and unpleasantness.

Now Folks! won’t you tickle
the Doctor’s vanity by wondering what kind of a Doctor he is?

You know there are many
signs that our civilization is
advancing. Some school masters are called professors. Wash
women of the old days are now
called char-ladies. Commercial

travellers do not “‘sell’’ today,
They make ‘‘contacts’’. A sojourner in a hotel is not a
‘boarder’ but a ‘‘guest’’, up to

the moment he payes his bill.
Then he becomes a “ guest whose
patronage is appreciated’’,—if
the bill is of a large enough
amount.

There has not been an official
war between the nations since
1918. The Doctor is not alarmed because the first World Conference for economic peace, held
in London last summer, was a
bit of a failure and wrought

‘results as stable and beneficial

to the world as the first four
marriages of a Hollywood actress:

Some people in ‘Halifax and
the World” report that the
ideals of freedom and democracy
were vindicated in Nova Scotia
this past summer. Possibly
Premier Tolmie will report to
the Doctor on Christmas Day
that the same is true in British
Columbia.

Too bad our great-great-grand
parents missed having that instinctive longing of the human
heart (love of being fooled) administered to by the science of
modern advertising. How grateful we should be that our parents
were not bashful, nor man-haters
nor woman-haters.

Why! by merely cutting out
the coupon that modern affliction called natural obesity can
be routed at the rate of three
inches in ten days. You can be
a musician in thirty days, and
through having the personality
and the ‘‘It’’ (to copy from King
Alfred’s English) of a carrot,
you can become socially possible
with a cake of, Lifebuoy soap,
and an Elbert Hubbard scrapbook. For a few extra cents?
not sense, you can become socially probable by getting a commission and uniform in the
militia via R. M. C. or a university course by mail or otherwise.

The Doctor is told there is a
catch to the last type of advertisement. The story is, that
after completing a course 'be it
in the Arts or professions, with
or without honors, be the graduate rich or poor, some universities insist on a twenty dollar
fee for proclaiming your achievements on their own paper. The
Doctor is told the supply of
paper for parchment purposes is
dwindling. Therefore while the
legislators seek to conserve our
pulp-wood by enactments called

‘one-five-one,”” the Universities
anticipating a sharp incline in
the price of paper by 1999, set

these fees aside to purchase paper
when the crisis comes.

The Doctor is given another
explanation, namely that this
twenty dollar graduation fee is a
safeguard against the contingency of our civilization retro-gressing to the point where religious
and educational property not
owned by the state, should be
taxed just as Docto1 Hamilton's
hen house and week-end camp
on Park Avenue is taxed.

The Doctor is told that the
only objection to this fee is the
feeling it inculcates in those
who pay it, w hich 1 is akin to the
“love of country”’ in the bosom
of an American pacifist in the
last war, who enlisted??? and
fought not because he wanted
to but because of the manner in
which the government asked
him.

The Doctor is the Board of
Governors of the Key-Hole Karrespondence School. He feels
graduates who pay this fee have
no cause to complain, because

have to pay much more than
twenty dollars for their degrees

something should be done to

Some of the senior girls are already helping with ground hockey bit it is too much to expect
from them to carry on this work
for any length of time. It re
quires a full time coach and the
‘question is will there be a new
appointment at Dalhousie?

Last year under the capable
management of Carl Howse the
Dal Soccer team carried off
major honors in the City Civilian
League. The team was only
defeated once and that time by
the crack St. George’s Aces.
Later on Dal got revenge for
this defeat.

This year the Dal team is
obliged to play for the Dennis
Cup being the present holders
of the trophy. An invitation
has also been evtended to enter
into competition for the Milne
Trophy.

Soccer is not a major sport at
Dal, for various reasons, but the
writer hopes that it may become
so before long. Last year the
team was hampered greatly by
lack of funds and the inability
to obtain a place and time for
practice. But the spirit of
“Sport for sport’s sake’’ was
predominant, the team worked
hard, gave valuable time and
thoroughly enjoyed themselves.

A unique feature of last year’s
team was its cusmopolitan per
sonnel. On the team were re
presentatives from Canada,
7

Newfoundland, Ireland, West

Indies, South Africa and China.
Soccer is a more universal game
than. rugger and recognizes the
same rules everywhere. Soccer
is not classified as Canadian,
American or British. Therefore
it is the logical game for interuniversity and inter-national
competition.

In the last few years Soccer
has made great strides in the
common schools. In different
parts of America large univer-.

sities have taken up the game.

McGill sends a team to the U.S.
every year to engage in competition. A good soccer team would
certainly make more of an impression than a good rugger team
for rugger is comparatively unknown to outside students. —

Unfortunately Dal has lost
Edgar House, Captain and star
half-back of last year. Others
have not come back to College,
but there are at present about
six new players to fill the vacancies. Please watch the notice
board for the various meetings
and practices.

There is nothing to hinder
Dal from having good senior and
intermediate teams this year as
we have the material and a
retired international player has
consented to act as coach.

In a poorly played exhibition
match between the two intermediate teams, the Dalhousie
Cubs were defeated 3 to 0 by
the Acadia seconds. Acadia had
a decided edge in all departments of the game and only
brilliant tackling saved the Gold
and Black from greater defeat.

It was evident at the start
that the Cubs lacked practice
as a unit, because there wasn't
a single backfield run. The forwards couldn't match their heavier opponents who hooked the
ball to their backfield time after
time. The Acadia threequarter
line got away for some long
runs, one of which resulted in
their lone try, D eWolfe crossing
the line on a pass from Lawrence.
The one redeeming feature of
Dalhousie’s side was the manner
in which they turned back attack
after attack in the shadow of
her goal posts.

D. G. A. C. MEETING.

The Dalhousie Girls’ Athletic
Club held the first meeting of
the year on Thursday, October
5th, in the Arts Building. It
was gratifying to see so many
Freshettes present, but the Upper classes made themselves conspicuou's by their absence—about three being present. It is
hoped that the Freshettes will
support the Dalhousie Co-ed
teams as well as they turned out
for the meeting.

Miss Barbara Walker, President of D. G. A. C. gave the new
students a short talk on sports,
pointing out the benefit of physical exercise to the student, who
has a great deal of mental work
to keep up—both should go hand
in hand.

A girls’ tennis representative
was elected—Miss Isobel Fraser.
It was decided to postpone the
election of the Assistant Managers for the various sports,
since the co-ed student body was
so poorly represented.

 

The managers, elected last
spring, are as follows:
Ground Hockey — Margaret

Woolaver.

Basketball — Florence Keniston.

Badminton — Marion Findlay.

Track—Ruth Crandall.

Ice Hockey—Merle Purtill.

The Managers of the sports
are ready and willing to give all
the help they can to the new
students as well as the old.

TURN OUT FOR SPORTS!!

For a number of years after
the formation of the Northern
Union, English Rugby Union
Football languished, and that

country met with a series of
defeats in the annual International contests with Scotland,
Ireland and Wales.

By bringing to perfection her
four threequarter system, Wales
was supreme for about a period
of ten years. The speed and
accuracy of the Welsh passing
was such that no other country
could vie with it, but this passing
was confined to the halves and
threequarters and in no instance
did the forwards join in. The
duties of forwards in those days
was to push with might and
main to secure possession fot
their backs. An occasional
dribble of course helped to vary
the monotony, but their real
function was to get the ball to
the backs.

The country was fortunate in
having such: a master strategist
as E. Gwynne Nicholls amongst
its players and during this period
Wales produced such football
giants as E. T. Murgan, Rhys
Gave, Llewellyn Trew, Dicky
Owen, R. Jones and the famous
James. brothers Gradually,

however, ‘“‘poaching’’ by the
Northern Union Clubs took

away the best players until the
level of the Wales of today has
been reached. Wales has lost
hundreds of men during the
past decade and it is indeed
hard upon the Welshmen and
it speaks volumes for the latent
resources of the principality that
their game is really as good as
itis. Up till 1905 Rugby Football in any of the four countries
was not making the progress
that it should, but with the coming of the never-to-be-forgotten
New Zéaland ‘All Blacks’’ the
game was revolutionized. Their
game with its ‘‘ Diamond scrum”
of seven men, a wing forward,
one halfback, two five-eighths,
three threequarters and a full

back, took the old country by
storm. Immense crowds attended the games and the enthusiasm was unbounded.

Every man of the All Blacks
ran and passed the ball. Forwards as well as backs, quick

scrums, little kicking to touch,
combined with clever running
and dodging served to electrify
the English public. A masterful use of the ‘‘Dummy’’ helped
as well and the Rugby Game
started on an era of prosperity
it has ever since retained.

One thing the old country
public could not understand was,
how seven forwards. beat eight
both in the tight scrums and in
quick heeling of the ball. Of
course when the manner of their
passing, the direction of the
diagonal push and the tunnell
up the centre of the scrum,
came to be known the mystery
was ended, but even to this day
Englishmen maintain that the
seven man scrum is only for

specialists. Later on we will
deal with the various scrum
formations and also with the

Rugby League Game the Northern Union; and explain how it is
played by its thirteen players.
In fact it is almost certain that
this type of game will be favoured for the Inter Faculty League.

We, in Canada, have little
opportunity of bringing our game
to the perfection it has attained
in New Zealand, South Africa
and Australia. Our climate forbids it, and it is indeed creditable
that we play as well as we do.
Errors twhich we will deal with
later; have crept into it, and it is
the intention of the Dalhousie
Football authorities to eradicate
as far as possible all these misdiscreption of players, scuring,
and terms used in describing the
game?

With this object in view we
are publishing these Football
articles.
