Dent. Notes

The social season starts officially tonight when our first Smoker will be
held in the Munro Room, Dr. Ritchie
and Dr. Bagnall will be the speakers
of the evening. The Dean will also
have a message.

These Smokers were very popular
last year and should go over big again.
Debates and Council activities being
the cause of most of the discussion.

Friday night the Seniors upheld their
prowess when they defeated the Junior
Class. Owing to the tardiness of three
members of the latter team only one
game could be played but this .was
decisive. No big scores were made
but promise is given of a successful
season in this line. Chaisson and
Angus Sinclair were the high scorers.

Room,—The late Mr. Parker. Ah,
Good evening, Hardy.

The tooth pullers now take their
own x rays. Due to a misunderstanding they did not, in the past few years,
take them themselves. The restriction is now lifted and they are taking
advantage of it to get in some very
useful practice.

It was noticed with pleasure that one
of the members of the faculty recently
received the honor of the presidency of
the Canadian Dental Association. Congratulations, Dr. Faulkner,

HALIFAX, NOVA SCOTIA, OCTOBER 22nn, 1930.

Changes In The
Law ) Faculy

The Faculty of Law has this year
undergone reorganization that has
affected every member but Dean Smith.
Professor Horace E. Read has been
promoted from the rank of Associate
Professor to that of Professor, and
appointed Secretary of the Law,
Faculty in place of Professor Angus L.
MacDonald who resigned at the end of
last year to enter the practice of law.
Professor Vincent C. MacDonald and
Mr. John L. MacQuarrie have been
appointed to the Faculty this year.
Now, for the first time, the Dalhousie
Law School has four full time lecturers.

Professor MacDonald, who is a
native of Halifax, graduated in Law
from Dalhousie in 1920, winning the
University Medal. His career, has
been brilliant and varied. He has
been Law Clerk to the Nova Scotia
House of Assembly; was at one time
Assistant Secretary to the Duncan
Commission on Maritime Claims; and
was for a short time secretary to exPremier King, During the three years
previous to his appointment here, Professor MacDonald has practised law in
Toronto. Last year he was part time
lecturer at Osgood Hall Law School in
Bankruptcy and Sales. At present he
is Editor-in-Chief of the ‘Dominion
Law Reports’’; in 1928 he directed the
publication of ‘‘Dominion Law Annotations,’’ a collection of commentaries
on almost the entire field of Canadian
Law. Before going to Toronto, Professor MacDonald was law partner to
W. J. O’Hearn, K. C., at ‘that time
Attorney General for Nova Scotia and
now judge of the County Court.

The new full time lectureship is
filled by Mr. John L. MacQuarrie, a
native of Westville, Pictou County,
who graduated from Dalhousie in
Commerce in 1927 and in Law in 1929,
Mr. MacQuarrie won the Coswell
prize in each year of his law course.
For some time he was associated with
the law firm of MacDonald and MacQuarrie, in Pictou, and during the
year previous to his present appointment was a member of the legal department of the Royal Trust Company,

The Dalhousie Law Faculty has
always been noted for its contributions
to public life and to the literature of
the law. Dr. Angus L. MacDonald’s
election to the Liberal leadership in
Nova Scotia is a well known illustration of the former fact; instances of the
latter, although not so conspicuous,
are equally meritous of attention.
Within the past month Dean Smith in
colloboration with Dean Falconbrigde
of Osgood Hall has published a ‘‘Manual of Canadian Business Law” dedesigned primarily for use in schools
of Commerce. In Ontario the Department of Education has adopted
this book for use in commercial high
schools. Professor Read has in process of publication a case book on the
“Law of Personal Chattels’’ which will
be used as a text at Dalhousie and
Osgoode Hall Law Schools. Professor
MacDonald, in collaboration with Professor Clute of Osgoode Hall, has just
completed a case book on the ‘Law
of Torts’’ which will also be used at the
two Schools. In addition to these,
contributions by members of the Dalhousie Law Faculty to Canadian legal
periodicals are numerous and regular.
Such efforts reflect favourably upon the
authors, and upon the School they
represent,

Pine Hill Initiation| ]mperial Debaters Capture
Judges Decision

Successful

On the night of Saturday, Oct. 11th,
that despised and rejected class of
Mortals known as Freshman ceased
to exist. In it’s place appeared a
group, a singularly fine group, of new
residents, But all this did not occur
without ceremony. The celebration
was the climax of a most instructive
and intertaining programme, of some
three weeks duration, provided by the
high and mighty Seniors for the benefit
of the verdant.

On the evening in question, immediately after the evening repast, all
Freshmen assembled in the Common
Room. Evening dress prevailed, and
the originality and uniqueness display were sufficient to delight the
heart of any fashion expert. After
checking up on the guest register the
party proceeded to the college building,
where full scope was provided for the
Freshmen to work off surplus energy.
The opportunity, without the practice,
seemed quite sufficient, enthusiasm on
their part was noticeably lacking.

Then each Freshman received individual attention within the gym.
Escorted one by one to the reception
chamber, each was heartily received,
and invited to take a comfortable seat
and await his turn. Curiously enough
none seemed to wish to delay proceedings, for no sooner did one seat himself
than he bounded up with a spring that
would make Ralph Miller look as if he
had neuritis in both legs. It was
simply shocking. Then for a time the
Freshmen began to see red. We are
sorry to admit, also, that practically
all displayed a yellow streak in the
region of the ear, Next our new
comers were given cause to realize that
though on the surface they are no
longer freshmen, yet within they are
green. Hereupon the fourth year
meds feared disastrous consequences,
and took precautionary steps, using
time tried remedies. Disgusting to see
the verdants lack of appreciation,
Figuratively the Seniors proceeded to
heap coals of fire on their heads, but
actually found a more suitable shampoo, Seniors next proceeded to display hitherto unsuspected artistic
talent; in fact the products of their
art looked almost like living men. In
order to prevent any freshman from
getting cold a protective covering was
supplied, which in every case was a
perfect fit. The Fresh then instituted
anew vogue. We've heard of flag-pole
sitters, but Pine Hill has a wonderful
group of pole-climbers. They are not
looking forward to further practice.
Each Freshman then returned to the
Residence, took a cool, refreshing showerand gazed inhismirror to view a new
and better man—a Hiller,

The programme continued in the
Common Room. Music and specialties
entertained at first; Tom MacDonald
made an eloquent and fitting speech of
welcome, concluding in by a much
appreciated ceremony in which those
odious regulations known as ‘‘Freshman Rules’’ were forever removed from
view. Refreshments were served, and
duiing the serving each Freshman
introduced himself. College, Faculty
and Prep Schools yells were given, and
finally the programme came to a close
with the singing of “For They are
Jolly Good Fellows.”

Another group of ‘‘mere freshmen”’
have become Pine-Hillers.

 

Thirty Acadian Visitors Fail to

A host owes a certain courtesy to
one whom he entertains as his guest.
Dalhousie, when acting in the capacity
of host, endeavors to display all courtesy to her guests. She has a right to
expect in return that those who are
her visitors will conduct themselves
as gentlemen when enjoying the University’s hospitality. Consequently,
when supporters from a neighboring
college come to Halifax in order to
cheer on one of their athletic teams in
contest with Dalhousie and conduct
themselves in a manner unbecoming
University men and gentlemen it is
a matter of grave regret.

Specifically we refer to the action of
some thirty or more Acadia supporters
in “crashing the gate’ during the
progress of the second team game last

Saturday without having had the
honesty to pay their way into the
grounds. Supporters of Dalhousie
teams who have gone to Wolfville in
the past have behaved as gentlemen,
sometimes in the face of great provocation to conduct themselves otherwise. Visitors to Dalhousie are expected to conform to this standard.
It is here suggested that the student
body of Acadia, on behalf of those of
its membership who -descended to
trickery and discourtesy last Saturday
make retribution to Dalhousie by forwarding to the Student's Council the
money withheldfrom the ticket-sellers,
accompanied by some intimation that
the serious breach of hospitality committed does not represent the usual
actions of Acadians when supporting
their teams in their outside games,

Dictatorship is Upheld

In spite of the inclemency of the
weather last Saturday night, a record
audience turned out to hear the debate
that President MacKenzie described
the best he had ever heard at Dal
housie. All four speakers were excellent, both in the material and delivery of their speeches, Every address Was ingenious and _ interesting
and held the attention of theaudience
from beginning to end. President
MacKenzie presided and introduced
the visiting debaters in a short address
of welcome. Mr. Fred Jennings outlined the purposes of the National
Federation of Canadian University
students under the auspices of which
the debate was conducted. Mr. Trevor Lloyd opened the debate for the
affirmative.

Mr. Lloyd, before broaching the
subject of the debate, paid tribute to
the Canadian debating team that
toured England a few years ago, and
to the members of the National Federation of University Students who had
arranged the present tour of Canada.
He paid tribute also to Prof. C. MacInnis, a graduate of Dalhousie, who has
done much to bring into closer touch
the students and staff of Mr. Lloyd's
own University of Bristol.

We cannot regard the world of today,
said Mr. Lloyd in the light of Victorian
philosophy. During the Victorian age,
a vast amount of taith was placed,in
existing institutions; democratic institutions in particular seemed invincibly substantial, But since that happy era, the world has watched its
cherished monuments totter and fall.
Within a space of two decades great
empires were overthrown whose bulwarks had previously seemed invulnerable. Democracy began to experience difficulties.

When the world was young, and
political institutions were in their infancy, type of government was not so
important a national factor as it is
today. Then the margin of error was
wide, mistakes in government were
absorbed in it, and no great harm resulted from them. With the advance
of civilization, this margin has narrowed
and mistakes that occasioned little
harm long ago would today be perilous.
Aristocracy was tried, and for a time
deemed adequate. Then the daily
increasing demands on government
caused it to be abandoned for democracy. Today democracy is being tried
and found wanting. Democracy is
inefficient. It expends itself in talking
at the expense of acting. The Dail is
spoken about throughout Ireland as
the ‘‘Dublin Gas House.”’ The conditions under which Democracy in
many instances flourished have ceased
to exist. At the time of the Declaration of Independence, America, guided
by spiritual and religious standards
professed the doctrine that all men
are born free and equal, and this doctrine forms the key note of Democracy.
But standards have changed, and even
though we would be blind to it, we
must admit that rulers and dictators
have sprung up in the realms of banking and of industry. The Democracy
to today is a shadow government; the
real actors we refuse to recognize.
The age of Democracy has passed
away; today we have the utmost difficulty in securing a representative who
will represent anyone but himself.
It is time to change. Men must face
the facts, and, throwing off these
shallow pretentions of equality, confide their destinies to single efficient
and conscientious individuals. The
solution of world’s problems lies in
relinquishing same degree of personal
liberty to follow those who are most
enlightened.

Mr. Ernest Howse opened the debate for the negative. He welcomed
the visiting debaters and expressed the
hope that they would return home
with renewed confidence in the strength
of British Democracy.

THE UNIVERSITY STORE.

The much talked of University store has at last become a

i ~ reality under the sponsorship of the Canadian National Institute

j eer the Blind. It has extended its original function of a book store

only to include in its stock sundry supplies and articles offering

_ refreshments to students, overcome by hunger or thirst. Primarily

. of course, the store is intended to serve as a means of saving money

for Dalhousians by allowing them to purchase books necessary

in class work at cheaper prices than they would be obtainable else
where. Its added functions already referred to increase its appeal

and no doubt add to its revenue.

a Although hampered by a situation which does not provide the

greatest amount of accessibility it nevertheless is attracting a

ban _ steady clientele who are appreciative of the benefits offered. Ina

venture of this sort the first. year is undoubtedly the most difficult.

The success already achieved by the store is a good augury for the

Pt a tte future when we may expect to see more commodious quarters

Ae sh provided and even further inducements offered to the student to
epaenrs his books and other supplies in the University store.

) - How often in our own experience have we read of
inl “the ol Poi best’’ dance ever held? How many times have
_ we been assured that ‘‘this is the finest team which the University
has put forth in years”? Sometimes such reports are true, but in
most cases are, like the news of Mark Twain’s death, grossly exaggerated. In this connection did you ever hear of a student who
had achieved perhaps some slight recognition in an academic way
who was not immediately labelled ‘‘brilliant’”? That is an overworked word if ever there were one. Then there is the exaggeration
of the deeds of stalwarts of other years. There never will be
another class like that of ‘umpty-eight. Those were men and
heroes all. But sober reflection reminds us that college classes are
much the same from year to year and from decade to decade. Only
distance lends a certain distinction. Undoubtedly in the old days
Dalhousians performed Herculean deeds but don’t exaggerate
those deeds out of all proportion to their real importance.

Why object to exaggeration, particularly in college life, one
might say. ‘This closing of eyes to defects stimulates interest and
maintains college pride and spirit. High coloring, if skilfully
applied, is attractive. To which we reply that exaggeration is
after all a sacrifice of truth, and merely a course of deception in an
attempt to prove to ourselves that we are something which in
reality we are not. We believe that a false statement of values
harms an institution. The way to excellence in achievement lies
ina clear-eyed appraisal of our present status. Falsity and exaggeration should have no place where students are honest with
themselves and with their University.

THE COLLEGE PROFESSOR.

The term, ‘‘a college professor,” was always rather a fearsome

one in the days before we had experienced University life. It}.
called to mind a be-spectacled bookworm, terrible in his disgust o1
the stupid one, hard-hearted, eagerly seeking an opportunity to
bring to an untimely end the college careers of the students who
sat under his guidance. Invariably was he an absent-minded
person, very fond of such tricks as throwing his wife out-of-doors
and retiring with the cat. With abstracted air, he surveyed from
lofty height the childish pursuits of all students who were not
Be sc _ insatiable seekers after pure book knowledge even as he. The

hard-hearted, and also there are very few that are absentay 4° ae inded to such an extent as we had believed them to be. In fact,

in this respect they resemble most people who can’t remember

‘Argue About

(A column inviting comment and con
troversy).

Once in a while some inquisitive soul
Taises a aay as to the practical
efficacy of the lecture system now so
This system
though undoubtedly possessing its
limitations, is perhaps less to be
censured than those who administer it.
For the professor, the lecture is an
eee medium through which to

lay his effusive eloquence, his
car ying erudition and his enviable
beasties He also gets an intellectual workout, and earns his salary
with a minimum of exertion. For the
student, on the other hand, the lecture
system is a farcial failure as far as
encouraging any real independent thinking. He sits (or sleeps) through the
classes, sometimes listening, sometimes
not, and a few weeks before the end
of the term he undergoes the process of
sponging up as many facts as possible
in as little time. During examination
week he squeezes his brain dry, is then
given a degree, and finally is shoved out
upon the hard, cold world—an ‘“educated’? man. We suggest that this
ridiculous situation could be improved,
if more discussion and less lecturing
took place in the classroom. The
ancient Greeks [appreciated the value of
intelligent discussion, and if the professors instead of lecturing at us, would
condescend to talk with us, a great
deal would be accomplished in the
interests of true education. What
do you think?

Some rather pertinent inquiries have
lately been made regarding the value
of fraternities in university life. And
the results of this investigation are
certainly not very favourable towards
the Greek letter societies. Although
the ideals of fraternities are most
worthy and commendable, yetitseems
unfortunately true that they arerarely
lived up to with any degree of sincerity.
Too often, a fraternity develops into
an establishment where hard drinking,
gambling, and other somewhat questionable amusements are indulged in
with impunity, and the academic
standing of the average ‘“‘frat man”’ is
considerably lower than that of the
student who knows not the secret grip,
or who is unable to flaunt ‘‘a pin”
upon his manly bosom. Fraternities
encourage a spirit of snobbery on the
campus, and during the “rushing”
season a feeling of enmity is sometimes
felt when a well liked freshman is
grabbed up by a fraternity of doubtful
merit. This splits the students of the
college into many petty groups, each
striving to down the other. Dalhousie
has nowabout nine fraternities in her
midst. Are they_proving, or will they
prove of value to her in times to come?

The antics of our collegiate brothers
in the Annapolis Valley often provide
us with a good deal of amusement.
Especially. in the realm of athletics, do
we note their customs with a facetious,
yet withal troubled mien. We read
with avidity, that a wildly enthusiastic

“pep” meeting was held in preparation
for a forthcoming game; that the
husky football squad staged a most
enlightening ‘“‘skull practice;’’ or that
Coach Goofus delivered himself of a
most inspiring “fight talk’’ for the
edification of the gridiron Warriors.
“Pep meetings,’’ ‘‘skull practices,”’
“fight talks,’’"—O Tempora! QO Mores!
All this is indeed a far call from the
noble traditions of British sportsmanship, which do so much to make athletics really worth while. The above
weird and wonderful concomitants of
present day sport, arise from a state of
mind which has as its object not the
playing of the game in a hard, clean
manner, but the winning of the game
at all costs. The result is that we are
all developing more or less, into poo
winners and worse losers. We may
well take a lesson from the Englishman in this regard; for although the
English produce few champions, they }h
produce what are far more important—
sportsmen!

We have a sneaking suspicion that
the benign Senatus Academicus regards
the student body rather as a band of

carefree, high school lads and lassies!

than a group of men and women who
presumably know what they are doing.
At least one might easily gather that,
from some of the juvenile regulations
to which we are asked to conform,
For instance, take the ruling which
renders a man ineligible to play football
for the university in the Fall, if he has
failed to pass a certain percentage of
his examinations in the preceeding
Spring. Where is the rhyme or reason

in this? We unblushingly confess we
are unable to see either. By prohibiting a man to play football, you do not
increase his desire to study, In all
probability, he will watch most of the
practices from the sidelines, and will
attend every game, Or else, the time
formerly devoted to the healthy outdoor sport, will be spent in some other
manner—not on his work. But more
important than this, is the fact that
by thus regulating and restricting the
student, you implicitly deny that he
knows what is best for himself or that
he is able to decide matters of importance. When a student is admitted
to a university he should be permitted
within reason, to act as he pleases. If
he cannot be thus trusted, he should
not be allowed to enroll in a university
atall. Let us havea little less juvenile
treatment, and let us enjoy a little more
the confidence of the authorities,

GOOD CHE! CHEER?

For several years past McGill suffered, or if you will, benefitted from a
dearth of cheer-leaders, This present
session is no exception to the general
rule and with the advent of the football season of 1980 there is just as
little enthusiasm for the exalted position of cheer-leader as there was away
back in 1929. However, we do manage to find individuals capable and,
with a little persuasion, willing to
undertake the difficult task of getting
some meaningless noise out of an
apathetic, with a combined display of
St. Vitus dance and sharp attack of
acute indigestion.

The scarcity of cheer-leaders raises
in our minds the question of whether
crowds now-a-days are not a little
more individualistic than they were
in the good old. times when a leader
could really get action and noise out
of the “gang”’ in the bleachers, There
was a time when each and every student in the crowd could be depended
upon to shout himself hoarse at the
command of the leader, but now there
is a subtle something creeping into
organized cheering which makes for
reticence. Indeed, a few of our
acquaintances admit that they feel
‘more than a little foolish when they go
to games, sit in the ‘‘rooters’’ section
and work up false and superficial
enthusiasm over incidents which they
could do greater justice to with a good
full-throated roar than with what they
consider silly jingling words chanted in
unison.

That organized cheering helps to win,
or that the lack of it helps to lose games,
is greatly to be questioned. Usually,
player on the field is so engrossed in va
game as to be impervious to the noises
around him whether laudatory or
censorious. Somehow a feeling has
grown up that organized cheering is
just another item on the program
provided for the paying spectators.

Then there is the somewhat deplorable psychological attitude of mind
which organized cheering has a tendency to bring about in a crowd. Oftentimes closely unified shouting diverts the attention of the spectators
from a good game to less laudable
focus on seeing a winning game.

In spite of all this, however, there are
undoubtedly many who would prefer
to stick to the good old method of
roaring as one voice believing that the
team does benefit to some extent from
their efforts.— McGill Daily.

FOR A MESS OF PUBLICITY

The composer of ‘‘The Blue and
White” definitely stated to ‘The
Varsity’”’ yesterday that it was up to
the students to decide whether or
not their song was to be entrusted to
the tender mercies of the crooning
Rudy.

Quite obviously the students don’t
want their song so entrusted, and it

‘now remains up to the S, A. C. ‘—which

meets at noon to-day—to go on record
in the matter. Mr. Valleee has our
song book, but we still have the copyright. If the S. A, C., acting on behalf
of the student body, decides that it is
opposed to the use of the University
song in dance halls and radio broadcasts arranged to advertise the merits
of somebody’s gum drops or arch
supporters, there can be no doubt that
the Board of Governors—to whom the
control of the copyright has been so
generously tendered by the composer—
will uphold the action,

If ‘The Blue and White”’ is to continue to mean anything at all in the
life and tradition of the University, its
use should be so restricted that in the
future it will only be heard at University functions. That the students are
whole-heartedly in favour of such restrictions has been made obvious
enough during the past two days. The
S. A. C. will be doing well to give a
definite token of its respect for this
sentiment and to align the University
of Toronto with Harvard and the

handful of American universities which
have held their traditions higher than
a handful of paltry publicity.

We cannot help feeling that the
University’s Publicity Director has
done little to enhance the Teputation
of his office by terming “justifiable
publicity” the handing over of an intimate article of the University’s
property to be bleated on the same
waves with bucolic blurges about
somebody-or-other’s tooth paste. At
exactly what date in its history did it
become necessary for the University of
Toronto to seli itself to the Great
Unpolluted in the same breath with
liver salts and canned prunes?

And to make matters worse, the
Publicity Director claims he didn’t
know who the redoubable Rudy was.

Farewell Dinner

Thursday evening the Kappa Alpha
Phi Fraternity held a farewell dinner
at their house on South Park Street
for their departing brother, Jack
Mahar. Jack left the city last. Saturday morning for Montreal where he
will enter McGill University to take
up Architecture. see loss will be
felt keenly by his Fraternity of which
he was an enthusiastic and untiring
worker, It will be felt also by a large
body of other students at Dalhousie
among whom he was popular. We
unite with the Kappa Alpha Phi’s
in wishing Jack Mahar all luck at
McGill.

He is accused of sundry crimes

and misdemeanours, of plucking this or that student ‘“‘on general

principles’ and so on.

But we pay tribute to him (evenif we are

accused of working for a pass in his classes) for his forbearance
under great provocation offered by many a criticism, for his willingness to assist any worthy student activity, and for the high ideals

of achievement he often unconsciously sets before us.

The soul never vel dite:
ever. The body—the mere garment
of the soul dies. Death is associated
with the passing out of the physical
form, What happens to the metaphysical form—that something which
is called the sould. Some speak of it
as the anima. Modern thinkers speak
of it as a vital force. Either it must
be completely annihilated or it must
continue throughout an infinite period.

This vital force is a present day
mystery. It is beyond the mind which
can only conjure up physical forms,
It is beyond the sphere of physical
conceptions. Its origin has never been
discovered, Its fate has never been
explained. It, therefore, must exist
in the form of a never- ending cycle.

What happens to the soul after
death? Does it be imprisoned and
await a judgment day when it will be
assigned to a Heaven or Hell? Oris it
immediately transported to a delightful Paradise and repose within a hz rem
composed of beautiful houris? Or is
it transmitted to physical bodies yet
unborn? The last alternative seems
to me to be the more reasonable one
For how could the conservation of
soul power be otherwise maintained?

Now if souls are transmitted to
physical bedies yet unborn, then their
punishment will be the same, unless
they are transmitted according to a
descending position in the evolutionary
series. This then seems to be the
logical way. There is no definite
judgment which ends in Heaven or Hell.
One's punishment will be determined
by one’s acts in a past life. In a
future life one is given a chance to
atone for one’s sins. Atonement for
one’s sins would eventually mean a
gradual rise in the evolutionary series.
Further bad deeds would place the
individual at the lower rung of the
ladder. Heaven and Hell would then
be earthly affairs. And this is as
things should be, where the individual
is given a chance to right his wrongs
in the past.

Now we can very well understand,
that the individual at the lower end of
the evolutionary series is not annihilated. But what is the fate of the individual who happens to be lucky
enough to reach the top-most rung of
the ladder?

When the individual reaches this
stage, he fully deserves to be transported to the homes of the Gods. For
to reach this height one must be the
essence of all that is good. And it is
exceedingly difficult to find a perfec}
individual.

If such be the nature of things, then
a future life may be something pleasant
toanticipate. For individuals would rather be judged by their own. actions.
They would prefer to have a chance
to make good than to be judged in a
definite manner and assigned to such
hazy regions as Heaven and Hell.

Freshmen

_ Arts defeated Freshmen in the opening game of the Dal Interfaculty Rugby
Saturday noon at the
Studley Campus by a score of 22 to 8.
The game was pretty much one sided
as the score indicates. Freshmen were
greatly handicapped as they were
short a number of men. Nevertheless

they worked hard to keep the more

experienced Artsmen from scoring all
the time.

The game started out very well
matched and during the first half of
the opening period, each team secured
one try. Anderson got the try for
Arts and O’Brien tallied for Freshmen.
Anderson's try was converted by McDonald. Freshmen's score was not
converted. After this the Freshman
team broke up almost entirely. McDonald scored another try; then Anderson got one again. The second period
was pretty much a repetition of the
-Arts scored three times. Anderson, Roy McDonald, and Henry Cunningham each got one try. Only one
attempt at convert was successful.

Charlie Anderson, Roy McDonald,
Wen McDonald and Magonet played
well for Arts. O’Brien and Conn
Sutherland were the pick of the losers.

Don McRae, interfaculty manager,
refereed.

Line-up—

Arts—Fullback, G. Fraser; Threequarters—W. McDonald, J. McDonald, C. Anderson, K. Sullivan; Halves—
R. McDonald, S. Webber; Forwards—
Cunningham, Doyle, McCullough, McLeod, Teasdale, Magonet, Ferguson.

Freshmen—Fullback, Dunsworth;

Tuesday

Dear Moms:—

Here beginneth your little dater’s
first epistle to you. Gee Moms it is
hard to write here tonight, cause the
excitement is so great. The phone is
ringing all the time and all the girls
are making a grand rush for it, to see
if itis a ‘“‘bid’’ for the Med Dance. Iam
still patiently waiting for the phone to
ring for ‘‘yours truly.”

Last night we had a very enjoyable
evening at a dance given by some
Council or other. It was a free dance,
Mom, and just everyone was there.
I wore my pretty red dress with the
purple sash, and"I lookedawfully swell.
One boy said I had eyes like purple
pansies, but that they weren’t shown
to best advantage with the red dress.
Was that a nasty crack? Well to get
to the point. One girl here had wet
hair at the dance. Guess what she
did? She fell head first into the bath
tub, just fifteen minutes before the
dance. Well the hurry and flurry of
it all. Some of us got towels and started rubbing, and the rest of us got newspapers and fanned, and so got her
almost dry. Wasn’t that a funny
coincident to happen? Doesn’t that
word express one’s feelings exactly,
Moms?

Some little Freshman took me to the
party last night, and mind you took
five dances out of twenty. Isn’t that
dreadful? But the girls say they all
take that many here, and sometimes
even six. Darling Isaac never used
to do that. How different these city
folks are from the country guys?

We had the nicest and thrillingest
invitation the other night, but I was
some scared, when they took us up
to the top story of this here place, and
turned out the lights. Then they
dressed usup as animals, and made us
pretend we were in a circus, and what
do you suppose? These perfectly
exasperating, atrocious, and utterly
depraved sophmores made me up as,—
oh, it was so embarassing, and such a
reflection on my figure, Ma, a “pig.”
Imagine your Lizzie Ann _ crawling
along the floor and grunting like a
‘pig’. My embarassment was almost
more than I could bear. Then we ate
“Ben's” cakes, a rare treat, and something utterly new at Delta Gamma
meetings.

Well, Ma, I saw a terrible game on
Saturday. Oh, gee, if my darling
Isaac ever plays it, I'll not die a natural
death. They were just oodles of men
on the field, and oh some of them were
divine, but all they seemed to do was
kick a silly ball, run a distance with it
and then just as they got near the line
the umpire would blow a whistle, and
then some boys would grab each other
by the necks, bend down and begin
kicking and running all over again.
Here this rough, uncouth game is
called football, And, Ma, once, mind
you a man grabbed one of our Dalhousie men, and bent him way back
just as if they were acting a scene in
one of Greta Garbo-John Gilbert
pictures. I was really -quite thrilled,
but I was surprised at the dramatic
ending for after he had bent him back
sufficiently, he threw him on _ the
ground, and grabbed that old football
and began running, and then the
umpire blew a whistle. To tell the
truth that is about all he did, just blew,
and made things start all over again.
Honestly speakin’ ma, | don’t think
I’ll go to another one of those things.

The King’s Freshmen look so cute.
Gee, the other morning they gave us a
lovely concert up-at Dal, on their
mouth organs, which included the
“Stein Song,’’ and an indelicate one,
“Love me.’ It lasted for about 10
minutes, and broke up just before the
bell rang for class. Why didn’t they
keep it up, so that they could show the
professors the future “Carusoes’’ in
our midst,

I see some boys looking through some
queer contraptions here on the campus
almost every day out by Shirreff Hall,
near the Murray Homestead, n’every
place. Ma, what can they be looking
at? There are no stars in the day time.
It is certainly queer, and some of them
look very intelligent, too. They are
called engineers here at this place.
It doesn’t seem much of a job to me.

I was on a ‘“‘bakin bat’’ last Friday.
I had a goot time. Be sure to keep
all those bats in the attic at home, and
don't let them escape, ’cause you and
I can bake some bats when I get home
next Xmas. They’re delicious, Ma!

I heard a Scotch joke the other day.
Tell it to Pa! By the way there is a
man here who is always cracking jokes
which I can’t understand. He laughs
at them all the time he is telling them.
He teaches Philosophy 1, but | won't
tell you his name, because it wouldn’t
be fair, Well here is the joke, There
was once upon a time a Scotchman so
mean that he carried his rubbers in his
pocket, and put them on only as he
reached a puddle in order to save the
rubber soles. Isn't that funny. Give
that anda kiss to Pa from me.

I saw a terrible thing on the street
the other day. Oh, quite shocking,
but I feel I should tell you so you will
see what Lizzie is up against. I was
down opposite the Public Gardens
yesterday, and I saw a boy stop, and
begin taking things out of his pocket,
Then he put a white collar around his
leg, and pulled a strip of white cotton
up his leg and safety-pined it on to his
waist. (1 can’t think of any other
word but waist). Then he put on a
white cap with an “F’’onit. Wouldn’t
you think, Ma, these boys would do
their dressing at home and not on the
public highways?

Must stop now, Ma dear, and take
a bath. Two a week is my motto,
No more, no less.

Lots of love,
“LIZZIE ANN.”

P. S. Give my love to darling Isaac.

Letter From

Pine

Once more the doors of Pine Hill
have swung open and today the corridors and rooms reverberate with the
exchange of greetings and the relating
of summer experiences. Many and
varied are the tales related. Some
have spent their time passively at
home, making themselves general nuisances. Others engaged in  reseach
in their favorite fields. Of all, our
theological brethren are perhaps the
most widely travelled. But let us
have some details—

Many prospective expounders of
the gospel have caused their mighty
words to be wafted on western winds.
Included among those are Warren
Langille, Bob Braine, Lloyd Marshall.

Others have given New Brunswick

|the benefit of their knowledge— Char
lie Anderson, Jim Millar and Harold
Marsten.

And yet others have given the breaks
to Nova Scotia. Elias Andrews did
his darndest to convert New Germany.
Clarence Nicholson, realizing the need
for spiritual guidance in his native
country, occupied a mission field in
Cape Breton.

All of these, with others, tell of
experiences which one would never
suspect existed on a mission field.

Among our doctors: Dick Crummy
was interne at the General Hospital
at Charlottetown. Watson Sodero was
“cutting up’’ among the miners at
Glace Bay General, and Micky MacDonald spent the summer recuperating
from a very strenuous session of 192930,

During the past two weeks a most
delightful programme has been carried
on at Pine Hill for the benefit of newcomers. The date of the official
reception has not been decided as yet
definitely.

The boys note with great satisfaction the coming of no less than three
violinists among the ranks of new
students. We'll hear more later from
Sweeney, Al and Gordon.

So marked was the improvement in
Dick Squires after a single year at

Dalhousie, that Sir Richard decided to |

|

send along another. Hence the appearance at Dal of Robert Squires,
student in fisheries.

We hear that the town of Stellarton
is seriously considering a move to grant
Pine Hill a representative on the town
council, When Tom MacDonald arrives back with two brothers, to be
greeted by Hank MacIntosh, and Mike
MacKay, and followed by the two
Fraser brothers, we feel that the most
and certainly the best of the town’s
population is within our walls.

The Kappa Sigs

Us Kappa girls have gone and done
it again. We’re positively thrilled to a
peanut! A room, actually, a room all
to our own. Gee! Wouldn’t you have
thought that the ‘‘Kamp”’ was pretty
hot stuff, but we have lots of snappy
little thoughtlets. What! you haven’t
heard about our camp! Dear, oh
dear, after all, what I mean is, how
couldn’t you!

Well, we went camping—in a bungalow, you know, but in case you don’t
know, it was all due to the kindness of
Dr. and Mrs. H. A. Payzant, who
placed at our use, their lovely summer
place at Waverley. Hither we went
one fine rainy day packed in Mary's
car, somehow among the blankets,
cushions, food, the portable, the odd
hat-box, and even a crate of oranges.
We stayed for nearly two weeks, and
how we could entertain you with
stories of our deeds (and misdeeds)—but
we won't. We really must mention
our party, oh yes indeed, we had a
party, as all who were lucky enough to
get a bid, can say. Big time was—etc.

We had, lots of visitors too, who were
welcomed with almost as much excitement as when our telephone rang,
When it was a car in the driveway there
was a scream of “Girls’’ and then a wild
stampede carwards. But a phone call
was an S, O. S. for Anne—you all know
our Anne Milne. (She’sa genius with—
that telephone).

The time, not to mention our provisions, went so quickly, and then we
had to do the hardest thing—go home.

However we did not pass right out of
the picture for a dance was held at the
home of Mrs. (Col.) Simms, which was
happily followed by another at the
home of Mrs. F. Smith. Two more
best yets!

And now we are going to start the
new college year with plans for many
great doings. At the summons of our
President, Mary Barbara Currie, the
Kappa Sigs assembled at the chapter
room and by the sonorous tones of the
cow-bell, sounded by Evelyn Oakes
Holloway, Guard, the first meeting of
the year was called to order. Many
important matters were dealt with and
duly recorded by our Scribe, Jane Smith
Laura Marshall is our Vice (but really
not half bad), and Marion G. Morton
counts our pennies. The Alumnae
Adviser is Jean Morrison.

An Answer to the Edi

Poetry

Full fain would I a poet be,
But modern thought constraineth me:g
Of old the poet sang in glee,—
But now:
‘Cirrhosis!’

I wandered to the beach one day
To watch the wavelets leap and play;
Entranced I stared, and heard—one say
‘Poor lad:

Psychosis!”’

I sing about the moon and trees,
Of shafts of light on lambent seas:
‘His bonnet's surely full of bees,”
Freud cries:g

‘‘Neurosis!”’
I fall in love with maiden fair,
Write sonnets to her silken hair,
My face grows pale and gaunt

spare:

Friends frown:

“Hypnosis!”
A hundred years or more ago
I might have reached Olympic snow:
To-day I’m forced to undergo
Meta—

Lost

From early dawn till twilight fell,

I wandered far, o’er dale and steep,
When in a nook, a fairy dell,

I faltered down to rest, to sleep.

That air, so warm and deathly quiet,

And paining eyes and limbs, it seemed,

Would drive me crazy; when, from a
branch,

A host of forming figures streamed.

A sprightly tread, a flashing eye,

A lovely princess all in white,

With straining-eyes, I saw her face;

A pearl, all amber set in pearly light.

The next, was a maiden I’m sure,

Her form, her face so ghastly pale.
Trembling, I saw in waxengrey.

Those sparkling jets that told her tale.

A surging feeling o’er swept me

To which, I had to surrender.

Me thought, I saw a rainbow formed,
The while the deadly form grew limber.

Her face warmer; her eyes part lids.

In faith, her cheek against mine pressed
Twas dying that murmuring sound,

At early dawn I woke refreshed.

Dal. Loses Debate

Continued from page 1.

_ Mr, Lloyd, said Mr. Howse, had
built up his dictatorship around one
‘great man. If ina Democracy, many
men misused their power, such misuse
‘might be more surely anticipated in a
Dictator. One fundamental argument
for Dictatorship is efficency. This

Play

 

efficiency has been exaggerated. a
and

own railway systems, hotels,
finances are in no point inferior to those
of Italy, But, granted an immediate
increase in efficiency under a Dictator;
still, the cost is too dear. If an ideally
perfect Dictator did exist,the price for
efficiency would be the will power of
the people. They would remain mentally impassive. According to James
Stuart Mill, the chief benefit of a
Democracy is that while people are
amending their affairs they are also
amending themselves. This benefit
would not accrue to the subjects of a
Dictator, they [would lose the power
to think.

Democracy has triumphed in spite
of its defects, and, if these defects
that exist in Democracy are lost sight
of in a Dictatorship, it is for the
same reason that a child forgets his
toothache when a red hot iron is applied
to his stomach. ‘‘He who rides a
tiger cannot dismount.’’ The Dictator
is carried from violence to violence by
the momentum of his own power.
Bloodshed and oppression are the
tenets of his philosophy. Freedom
and individuality, and everything we
have set our hearts upon, are, under a
Dictatorship, lost. The inherent evils
of this type of government are too
sinister for a thinking people to consider it. The sanctions of a Democracy
are the will of the people; the sanctions
of a Dictatorship are the mailed fist.
These evils are not peculiar to any one
Dictatorship; they are not incidental
evils; they are inherent in the principle
itself.

Mr. John Mitchell continued the
debate for the Affirmative.

In the world of today there are already many dictators. Several South
American so called republics are really
ruled by commercial dictators in the
United States. Dictatorship is a modern tendency. Even Dalhousie has
its Murray MacNeil. If we insist
upon ignoring these new rulers, we are
behaving like a man ,who maintains
that he is immune to bullets until a
cannon-ball carries away his head

DALHOUSIE GAZETTE

Mr. Howse has argued from the
particular to the general, and asks
you to infer that all Dictators are evil.
Such is not the case; for dictatorship
offers those qualities of devisenes and
of swift action that are lacking in our
present forms of government. It is

hard to maintain that Democracy is

a rule of the people, when the man in
the street does not even pretend to
exert any influence in the governing of
his country. Democracy is dead.

In examining the possibilities of
Dictatorship, it is unfair, as the supporters of the negative have done, to
presuppose that the Dictator will be a
villian. What we would like you to
consider is a good dictator. The ideas
of cooperation and sympathy existing
between the ruler and his subjects are
essential to an open-minded discussion
of the principle. It is necessary to
lay aside blind adherence to democratic
institutions and to regard Dictatorship
without prejudice. A Dictator is not
one, who having got control of a nation
rules its people with a mail fist, but
rather is he a person who, gathering to
himself the spirit of his time, is the
embodiment of that spirit. The light
of Democracy has gone out, and, had
we no other light to look to, it would be
best, as Plato said, never to have been
born, and next best to return quickly
whence we came. Fortunately we
may look to Dictatorship.

_ Mr. William Jost, for the negative
pointed out the danger of carrying the
discussion into the realm of philosophy,
and the necessity for adhering to the
terms of the resolution. Governments,
said Mr. Jost are divisible into two
classes; the one exemplified by Dictator
ship and possessing no guarantee against abuse of power, the other exemplified
by Democracy, and offering in political
parties a check against that abuse.
Dictatorship relies upon violence and
because of that it cannot endure.
Even.if a good Dictator could be found,
the burden of government is too heavy
for the shoulders of one man. The
genius that would be necessary in such
a man would likely be accompanied
by temperamental idiosyncrasies that
would render him unfit for his responsibility. And if the Dictator were
vicious and dishonest, the measures
that would depose a Prime minister
would be inadequate. In either case,
when a dictator died, it is improbable
that a competent successor could be
chosen, and the result would be chaos.

Democracy is a flexible institution
that has weathered many storms. It
is not a type of government that we
have arbitrarily adopted, but one
that has been developed during hundreds of years. Ojr fathers fought and
died for it; we must not lightly cast it
off for a type of government in which
we have had no experience.

Mr. Howse, in rebuttal, pointed out
that the affirmative were comparing
a fact with a theory. He pointed out
the danger of accepting remedies worse
than the ills they were meant to cure,
and submitted that when the circumstances of a good Democracy were
absent it would be impossible to found
a good Dictatorship if such circumstances were present, a Dictatorship
would be unnecessary.

Mr. Lloyd, in closing the debate
suggested that Democracies, too, had
been guilty of bloodshed and violence.
The Great War was brought on by the
jealousies of democratic nations. The
world, said Mr. Lloyd, has reached a
crisis; Democracy has failed. Some
other institution must be tried at once.
When the last man stands upon the
last battlefield, and looks upon the
tragedy of humanity, it will be too late
fo rola the need of individual leadership.

Maccabean Club |Dal S

The first meeting of the Maccabean
Club was held on Thursday evening
with I. Lubetski presiding. Among the
business brought up was thatof appointing a committee to select a number of
books which the club proposes to donate
to the University Library. Those
chosen on the committee are; Miss
Annie Linder and Messrs. Gaffen and
Rosenblum. The election of a secretary resulted in Mr. Phillip Magonet
being chosen for the office. Plans
were made to have a committee make
arrangements for the annual dance.

Freshie-Soph
Dance

The Freshie-Soph dance was held
on Monday, October 18th in the
Dalhousie gymnasium. About three
hundred people attended. The music
was supplied by Joe Mills’ orchestra.
The place was prettily decorated with
red and white streamers draped from
the centre of the building and extending to the sides of the building. The
chaperones were Prof. and Mrs. W. B.
Maxwell, Prof. and Mrs. James MacDonald, Prof. and Mrs. Bell, Mrs.
McNeil and Miss MacKeen.

 

 

Law Dance

The most brilliant function of the
college season was held on Wednesday
evening last, when the annual law
dance took place at the Nova Scotian
Hotel. Again people must admit, that
the lawyers are certainly a great crowd,
anddo their dances up in the best way
possible. About 300 people were pressent, and the dancing kept up till
almost 3 p. m. The music was extraordinarily good, and the orchestra
played about forty pieces in all. During supper the guests at the dance were
entertained by a delightful organ
recital. The chaperones for the evening were, Dean and Mrs. Smith,
Prof. & Mrs. H. E. Read, Prof. and,
Mrs. J. C. MacDonald, Dr. and Mr.
A. L. MacDonald, and Mr. and Mrs,
C, J. Burchell.

The Kappa Beta Phi Sorority opened

with a tea-dance on Saturday last at
the home of Miss Jean Morton. The
affair was a huge success, and was
enjoyed by all the guests due to the
efficient social committee, consisting
of Lillian Sadler, Jean Morton and
Helen Olmstead. About 50 people
were present. The music was provided
by D. Sadler and Don O’Hearn.
Mrs. Hugh Bell, honorary president
of the Sorority was chaperone.

That no criminals were on trial at
the second meeting of the Moot Court
is a source of gratification to all
thinking men. Perhaps potential criminals were discouraged by the ruthless
manner in which Mr. Justice Greene
pounced upon the offenders at the
previous meeting.

At any rate the only case on the
docket was a civil damage action, It
seems that Scholar, a student, was hurt
on his way home from school by the
fall of a rotten tree from the property
ofJones. Crouse and Underhay argued
the case pro and con, for two hours.
