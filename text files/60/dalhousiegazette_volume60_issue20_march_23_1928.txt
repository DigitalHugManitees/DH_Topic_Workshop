Correction

March 13, 1928.

Dear Mr. Jennings:—

Thank you most heartily for the
flattering account which you gave of
our ‘‘soiree francaise” of the 1st instant,
in the last number of the Gazette.
‘Your contributor however was misinformed when he stated that it was a

   

-Imeeting. of l'Assomption Society.

I
have the highest esteem for l’Assomption,
part in the
education of the French Acadians of
this country, and | will always consider it an honour to collaborate with
it, as indeed with all other societies and
persons whose aim is to promote the
study of the French Language and
Literature. But truth compels me to
say, that if the members of l'Assomption
attended the presentation of l’Ete de la
Saint-Martin in great numbers, they
attended as individuals and that our
soiree was neither prepared by nor
specially intended for the society of
which they are members.

Very sincerely yours
Rene Gautheron.

A Critic

March 14.

My Dear Editor:

The other day as I was going along
Barrington Street a member of Aris '26
hailed me thus: ‘“‘Huilo, M. A. B. where
have you been hiding? You. haven't
had a thing in the Gazette this session,
have you!” “No,” I said, ‘‘this year
I'm only an alumna, not a registered
student,” ‘‘Oh,” said he, ‘‘that’s a poor
reason for losing interest in the old
rag." And then for a few minutes
we discussed Dal and the Gazette and
a few minor things such as the rejected
increase (not ‘‘raise,”” my dear Editor,
surely) in the students’ fee.

And now I suppose it is time I gave
greeting and ‘congratulations to the
Gazette editor and staff. At the
beginning of the session I intended to
send you good wishes and then thought
I'd wait till a few issues had appeared.
Then, as I told ‘‘Arts ’26,” I discovered
that not only was I no longer enrolled
at Dal but that Dal had begun to speak
a new language, that not only were
most of the names in the Gazette new
and unknown to me but ‘that the owners
of them seemed to speak in a new and
unknown tongue! Of course, they often
mentioned the old topics—the lack of
or the prevalence of « College spirit
(there was certainly a lack of it at the
U. N. B. Hockey game!) is a -hardy

annual—but they discussed them in a’

yery modern language. . There ‘has
also been, I thinkji\an overdose of what
I would call Juvenile Literature, after
the manner of “The Rollo Boys at
Cambridge” and Dick Merivale’s Adventures.’ Now I accept that in grade
seven but discourage it in grade eleven,.
and feel that University men and women
should aim higher. ('Tis the voice of
the school-ma'am, I heard her: complain”!)... You know it takes a Leacock
or an Evoe to make something out of
nothing .by means of words. Am [
too severe? But. I.am convinced that
it is easier to write seriously and well
than to write humorously and well;
On

“A. M.” and Florence Brewster and
one or two others to strike the balance
of grave with gay and you must not
think I am finding fault with the Gazette. All the year it has been a bright,
lively, up-to-date paper but, eheu me!
it makes me feel out-of-date.

I felt this particularly when Mr.
Coffey’s letters appeared. I read the
first and some words of Sir Douglas
Haig came back to me, words that seem
‘prophetic now that his gallant soul has
won new fields. He was chatting with
a little group at St. Andrews, where he
was University Chancellor, and where
Thomas Hardy, Sir David Beatty. and
other distinguished folk had just received honorary degrees, and Barrie
had given us his inspiring Rectorial
address on Courage. Speaking of his
post. war duties the great soldier said
something like, ‘‘We must do what
has to be done for the disabled men
within ten years;-it must be done by
those of us who understand what they
suffered; those who were under ten
when war broke out will not only belong
to a new generation, but will be almost
a new race.’ And ten years after the
Armistice Haig is gone! When I read
Mr. Coffey’s second letter the term
“flippant’”’ came into my mind; it
seemed he was trying to be cynical and
not quite succeeding. He stated a
great many half-truths, spoke of Britain
and Germany rashly as one who had
visited neither country, mocked at
Nietzsche who, in spite of his strange
and seemingly cruel philosophy, was
from boyhood filled with the highest
ideals.

Then John Thurrott’s letter was
published and I read Mr. Coffey’s
letters again and decided that since
Mr. Thurrott found them reasonable
and sincere, it must be because I belong
to an older and pre-war generation
that I did not understand him, and
that it was because he belongs to the
new, post-war generation that he did
not know that we remember the Dead
and not the war, when we erect a memOrial. Yet I know that if he saw the
monument to Wilberforce he would not
call it a monument to Slavery! But
I must not take up any more of your
time. This long ramble may or may
not explain my aloofness from the
Gazette this session although I still
have a warm corner for it in my heart—
my memories of my year of service on
the Gazette staff are of the most pleasant. .

 
 
   
  

   

ht put it thus:

My lips are mute, for [ might rue

I mig
If I should speak my love to you;
My heart is dumb, 'twould cost too
dear
To utter all my hope, my fear;
Yet will the lence of my love
More clamorously my fealty prove;
For each day, as your footsteps go
By summer ways or winter snow,
Close to you, close,as a caress,
Shall go with you my, wordlessness.
With congratulations to you, Mr.
Editor, and to all your staff, and with
best wishes to everybody at Dal. in the
coming examinations.
Yours very truly,
Molly A. Beresford,

On Agriculture

 

March 12.
Editor Dalhousie Gazette.
engaged in
Agriculture and at present being slightly
connected with Dalhousie I should like
to. answer and extend P. L. H. Muschamp’s article on Agriculture appearing
in the issue of March 9, of the Gazette.
His opening paragraph is, alas, too
true and leads me to think that he has
had first hand experience with rural
problems, but after his opening paragraph his ideas become, to my mind,
too fanatical and the object he desires
to obtain is not the most desired one.
First—as an alumnus of the N. S.
Agricultural College (N.S.A.C.)—let me
explain somewhat the nature of the
courses taught there. There are two:
One especially for boys intending to
return to the farm and is termed a
‘Farm Course.’ It deals more directly

Sir:—As one actively

Diploma.

The second or ‘Degree Course’ requires one to have University Matto enter.

riculation Two years are

given at Truro and the last two at’

MacDonald College, Quebec, (or at
Guelph, Ontario Agricultural College).
Graduates are awarded the degree of
‘Bachelor of Scientific Agriculture’—
B.S. A. MacDonald College is a part
of McGill University and under present

arrangements the N. S. A. C. has, be
sides its own efficient staff, headed by}

‘Principal J. M. Trueman, B. S- A., two
of MacDonald’s, best :instructors | for
part time work.

Some students whose intent it is. to

return.to the farm take the first two.
years, of the ‘Degree Course’ in prefer-})

ence to the ‘Farm Course’. .because of
.the wider range of subjects studied.
I am_certain that anyoné who is interested, but at present not familiar with

the courses offered, would be surprised’

On persuing a N.S. A. €. calendar ‘to
note their extensiveness:'* *’ 
..\The questidn of téaching the full
four years degree course’ at Truro has
-been debated frequently in the past
but as yet the attendance does not seem
to warrant the extra cost: -- |

The best- example of the efficiency of
the N. S. Av C. in the pastds found.in
the fact that the graduatesifrom Truro
have been the leaders in the third and
fourth years at the Upper’, Canadian
Agricultural Colleges, year after year.

Mr. Muschamp hits a happy note
when he speaks of the economic side
of agriculture. A class in economic
and ‘social agriculture’ at Dalhousie
would be splendid, not so much because
it might attract students to the farms
but because a great many of you are
going to scatter Over our country as
Ministers, Doctors or. Teachers and you
are going to work and deal with farmers
and their children. How much
intelligently a teacher could instruct
her pupils and how much more successfully a minister could work with his
parishioners if they understood at least
the fundamental economic and_ social
problems of the people.

You who are to be teachers, ministers,
and who will carry on the leadership in
educational circles hold the ‘Master
key’ to the solution of the rural problem
of today.

It is a sad and muth regretted fact
that farming can easily become a drudgery especially, for the women, and
then it does become a menial task.
Why? Think for a moment of a lawyer
attempting to practice law at the end
of his first year in Law. Well, it can’t
be done; for one thing wise heads have
prohibited it. The same applies to all
professions. A person has to reach a
certain standard before he attempts to
put into practice his knowledge.

Thea think of the great mass of farmers who are working more or less blindly
with a great many principles, one of
which you may be specializing in here
at Dalhousie and finding four years
barely scratching its edge. In this
light one rather wonders that conditions
are as good as they are.
that Nature is kind and although she
seldom feasts her most intelligent interpreters she rarely starves her most
backward sons.

a

doesn't need an education.”
does a woman? Ask the co-eds.
_ Agriculture education does not pay
its greatest dividends in increased
wealth but in the beauty of increased
service, understanding and satisfaction
and opens for one a greater appreciation
of ‘the life’ in all its aspects.

What we need mostly are young mén
and women born on the farm who will,
after seeking a higher education feturn
to its bounds, filled with a greater love
for their ‘Heritage’ and resolved to do
their best to lift the name and life of
agriculture; and although the life as
they know it meant a great deal of
drudgery they will be able to sée over
the top to its glorious possibilities.

Neither

Here is where the teacher and the}
educational system’ must: help—in get- }

with practical farm problems and the
scholastic qualifications required to
enroll in it are slight; at the end of two
years the successful student receives a

  
    

more.

It is a blessing | |

From this latter arises |:
the oft quoted statement; ‘A farmer |}

   
 

 

Once more we feel the joyful inevitableness of Spring. Once more the
winding white way beckons to new
adventures. Which of you students of
Dalhousie will first this year discover
the freedom and the glory of the road?
Around the next turn fresh and varied
experiences are ever calling for you.
Who will come along?

Your car? Oh no, all the glory I
speak of flies before him who desecrates
the road with the noise, speed and stench
of an automobile.

But the glory of the road crowds upon
you as ¥ou;come tramping along the
by-ways... \Whither bound?—Who cares?
Why going?—I can no other wise. With
whom?—Why, with the birds and
the trees.and the meadows, and the
cottages by the wayside; with the blue
sky overhead, and the gray hills on the
horizon—and what will they say to you
as you wearily go marching along?
—I am never weary as | go marching
along; joy and leisure never allow me
to grow weary. But what will they
say to me, you ask? They will say
nothing unless [ ask them. For are
not our truest friends those in whose
company we need not speak in order
to’ be ‘happy?

But if the beauty of the meadow Is not
in itself sufficient it can speak to you
of long and persistent toil and struggle
and of present hopes and’ aspirations.
The trees can tell of the inevitableness
of human evolution and _ progress;
they can also teach you to be patient.
Each cottage by the wayside is a book
of life and love and learning, and the
blue sky is a treatise on divinity. But
the winding white road itself is your
own life.
Where will it take you to? When
will it end? Mountains and currents
will bend it hither and thither, but the
road, your life, will always find a way
out'and then will go on again over open
plains: the easy life, along winding
streams: the care-free life, through
dark forests, the sad life, over rough
ground: the uncertain and struggling
ife, up hill: the plodding life, and dowa
hill: the fruit of life.

Who will come and learn along the
Who will enter into the spirit
Who will learn

of the winding way?
to. say with Stevenson:

Wealth I ask not, hope nor love,
_ Nor a friend to know me;
_ All I ask, the heaven above
And the road below me?

ting: the boys and girls to see that

‘The public school has more influence
on the mind of a child than any other
supervised force outside the home,
-anchitis-from the school that much can
besdone to offset those things which at
present aré-driving our brightest boys
and girls away from the farm. As vet
thé-public, school system falls far short
of this goal: Here is where our keenest
intellects must get together and devise
a ‘system of education that will inculate
into young rural minds a natural love
for their heritage and at the same time
‘be applicable to children everywhere.

It would not be wise nor expedient,
ever if it were possible, to have one
‘system for Rural children and another
for’ Urban, nor should we cram our
curriculum with heavy agriculture subjects; what we want, now sadly lacking,
is a subject or subjects having as their
keynote “Beauty.” Any subject that
is, teaching appreciation of Beauty is
striking at the heart of “life,” ;
at the heart of nature. Under wise and
intelligent teachers children will then
learn to interpret ‘beauty’ in the light
of « their surroundings and will learn
to appreciate the beauty of their heritage, whatever it may be. In this
way ‘agriculture’ will come into its own.
' These few remarks have merely
scratched the edge of a huge and vital
problem but I trust some of you good
students of Dalhousie may see how by
taking a more sympathetic and active
look’ at ‘agriculture’ you may do much
toraise the standard of farming and
at the sathe time you will be furthering
the general prosperity of our country.

THE LIFE OF A
LITTLE COLLEGE

 

Congratulations to Dean and Mrs.
J. E. Read on the arrival of a baby boy.

ke *

A large and enthusiastic “first night”
audience greeted the re-opening of the
English 2 players at the Chemistry
Theatre last Monday morning.

The company, who presented Twelfth
Night have changed their personnell
almost entirely, the only familiar face
being that of Mr. C, L. Bennet who
played Orsino. Mr. Bennet ~will be
remembered as having played several
roles , last year—very often — simultaneously—and as a prime favorite with.
the audiences. Particular mention must
be made of Miss Killam,sas Olivia,
Fat MacKenzie, as Sir Toby~and Edward Murray as the fool.

But did Shakespeare write ‘‘The
More We are Together’’?

——__
The combined gym display and Glee
Club show will take place Tues. Apr.
3 and not Mar. 30 as previously announced. The Choral Society will make
their first appearance in a varied and
attractive musical program. There will
be a short French play, featuring a
new-comer to Glee Club but one who,
we are sure, will make a hit, Mr. George
Wright. <A skit by W. G. Dustan who
will be remembered by his habitant
monologue in a previous show. Mr.
Stirling is preparing a gymnastic program of hair-raising feats that are
guaranteed to -please. Mr. Stirling
himself will be seen in a wrestling bout
and a troupe of boy tunblers will show
you knockabout act that will surprise
you.

And so the Life of a
Little College has one
more year added unto
it.

 

Amen, |

 

S. C. A. SUPPER ON TUESDAY

 

There will be a supper meeting:of the
S. C. A. on Monday March 29 at six
p- m., in St. Andrew's Hall. This is the
final meeting of the year and a. large
meeting is expected. Mr. Harry Avison
of McGill will be there to talk to the
assembled company. Election of officers for next year will take place—
another reason for a large attendance.
We have every reason to. believe that —
Mr. Avison is a very interesting speaker,
and since he is eager to meet all those
people who are remotely interested in —
5. C. A. work it is hoped that there will ~
be a good number of S.C. Avers to meet = .
him. During Mr. Avison’s. stay the -.
Maritime Council will meet in Halifax,
when representatives from all the
colleges in the Maritimes come together
to discuss plans for next year.

 

The Statesman

 

The statesman throws his shoulders
back,-and straightens out his tie,

And says “‘My friends, unless it rains,
the weather will be dry.”

And when our brains this mighty thought
has percolated through,

We lesser beings: nod our heads, -andloudly cry ‘How true!”

The statesman blows his massive nose,
and clears his august throat,

And says ‘The ship will never sink, as *
long as it’s afloat.”

Whereat we roll our solemn eyes, applaud with main and might,

And slap each other-on the back, the
while we say ‘‘He’s right!”

Fi getting The statésman waxes stern and warm,

his drone becomes.a roar,

| He yells, ‘‘I say to you, my friends, that

two and two make four!”

And thereupon our doubts disolve, our
fears are put to rout,

And we agree that here’s a tian’ who
knows what he’s about. —Geedee

Jn Praise of
Altima

the Book of
Thule

 

There is an old saying to the effect
that on occasion “‘fools rush in where
angels fear to tread.’ It is a crime upon
which one would be inclined to meditate
long before he committed it. Rather
than prove myself guilty of such an
enormity by attempting something

1 }of which I am quite incapable, I hereby
}|refrain from giving this article, par# | agraph or piece of prose the classification
}/or title of ‘book-review.'

It is not a
book-review. It is a few words, a
sequence of paragraphs in ‘praise of’
Ultima Thule the latest book by the
distinguished Dr. Archibald MacMech
n.
Ultima Thule is written ‘in praise of
Nova Scotia.’ Dr. MacMechan knows

}}as well as anybody, indeed better than

most people, that Nova Scotia has
faults, many of them; but he is not
writing an economic treatice or a political tract, he is writing a book to tell
people how beautiful Nova Scotia is,
and what pleasures there are to be

| | enjoyed in the land of the mayflowers.

And, in my small way, wish to emulate

| his example by forgetting the faults of

the book if indeed, there be any and
concentrating on the book itself and its
meaning.

The book of Ultima Thule is written
in a clear, vigorous style, easy to read,
and with touches of subtle humour which
makes it delightful. It shows a wealth

|| of descriptive power of an unusual and

charming quality, which never wearies
the reader. Ah! what I have suffered
from reading long pages of fatiguing
description; but not so here: the nucleus
of the picture, a few touches of vivid
colour, a kaleidoscopic view, so to
speak, and the picture is there in all
loveliness or grandeur as the case may
be. The book should have a wide
appeal. The appeal to Bluenoses and
Maritimers is obvious, to the UpperCanadians it lies in the fact that the writer
is not a Nova Scotian but one of their
own province. It should appeal to
lovers of beauty, to lovers of adventure
and to lovers of literature. To those
vagabonds, the lovers of adventure, it
may not sound exciting to climb hills
six hundred feet high, which are called
mountains, and which are within fifty
miles of telephone or railway station,
but let him try the proper range of hills
in the wilds of Cape Breton and I'll
uarantee that he will not have cause
or complaint as to lack of thrills!

Dr. MacMechan knows the province
of Nova Scotia or Ultima Thule, as he
calls it, far better than many native
Bluenoses do, and he uses his knowledge to perfection in pointing out all

| dignity and decent c

the delightful little spots which, to the
casual sightseer or tourist might otherwise remain unknown. In an_ early
chapter the writer dives deep into the
history of the capital city; Dolufar he
will call it, though most of its inhabitants know it by its more prosaic given
name. The Province Building, old St.
Paul's, the Memorial Tower are among
the landmarks which the reader visits
under Dr. MacMechan's able guidance.
As in his mind he wanders through the
Province Building the reader can almost
hear once again the voice of Joseph
How so elopuently pleading his cause.
It is so with all these places where history
was made.

The archives of Nova Scotia have
known few busier fingers than those of
Dr. MacMechan. The founding of the
city, its growth and development are
described with an attention to detail
which, to those citizens whose memories
go as far back as the days when the main
street of Halifax was Hollis, must be of
particular interest. From the archives
the reader is entertained by the log of a
vessel sent on a privateering expedition
by the governor of Halifax, and whose
captain succeeded in doing little besides
raising the ire of the master of a French
vessel.

Enjoyable as these parts of the book
are they do not tell about the country
as it is today, as do those chapters
following. These rather are concerned
with the places which, when he travelled
through Nova Scotia on ‘‘Shank’s
mare,’ the writer visited the South
Shore, with its picturesque fishing
villages, Cape Breton with its magnificent scenery and the Atlantic Shore
with its delightful vacation resorts,
all come in for their due share of praise.
But for the ‘‘Happy Valley” which
means, of course, the Annapolis and
Cornwallis valleys, Dr. MacMechan's
admiration is unbounded. The tranquility of the Land of Evengeline, its
productiveness, its happy climate and
the hospitality of its people seem to
have impressed themselves indelibly
upon his mind. He falls into the
spirit of the people who live there.
He climbs the two “mountains” that
“make” the Valley, he swims in the
clear, sparkling water of the Bay of
Fundy, he even goes clamming in the
mud beneath Blomidon! That, to my
mind was the real test, the crucial point.
An admirer may enjoy the scenery
from the Look-off, he may gaze upon
majestic old Blomidon with admiration
he may praise our beautiful complexions,
but, unless he is willing to forsake all

be given some privileges of dress denied
their juniors. Yes, possibly that would
help. Another suggested that larger
grants would produce more winning
teams and so greater interest: The
third advocated compulsory athletics
or physical training.

The conversation had drifted into the
silence of despair when the fourth, who
had been silent until now, spoke up:

“There is a funny little trick which
human nature has, called compensation.

If you want something which you find }.

you are unable to get, you convince
yourself that you really didn’t want it
anyway, take something you can get
and say it was what you really wanted
all the time. Men or women condemned by circumstances to a sedentary,
virtuous life, will adopt a code of morals
which denounces all these pleasures
beyond their reach as sinful and vicious,
and that their inevitable culmination is
misery and unhappiness: they tell each
other what happiness there is in virtue
and they pity the poor wretch who is
enjoying himself.”

“‘Last week,’ he continued, ‘while
I was reading the Economics 4 text,
‘The Worker in Modern Economic
Society,’ I came to a paragraph which
pointed out just how this psychic compensation entered into the laborer's
life: If a man is employed at work which
is monotonous and uninteresting, which
gives him no mental exercise, he will compensate for. this in his leisure by a
craving for exciting, violent amusements. He will work at playing. . The
text went on to give so good an illustration that I took it down in my notebook; listen to this:"’

‘A familiar example of this compensation is that students, disappointed and
balked by the impersonal and_perfunctory instruction given in American
Universities, compensate .-by an enthusiasm over athletics ‘and. student
activities which, if properly expended. in

intellectual exercise, would revolutinize

society. College athletics is a sort of
psychic cure for the illness of experiencing a University education.’ .
The student closed the memorandum
book and continued; ‘‘As to why college
spirit, is dying out at present, I think it
is like this: As any history student will
tell you, after eyery great.war or social
upheaval there has been a_ veritable
renaissance of thought. My High

School history teacher used to tell us, |.

‘From all past experience, there ought

|to be several great men come from

this class. There always has been an

‘unusual number. of .great..men.in_ the.
‘generation which follows a war.’ I any}

imclined to think that is what has
happened to Dal. The students are
catching the spirit ‘Of the age—the
drama which, after two -centuries of
emasculation, is again on a par with the
highest in history—the literature which
argues for the revisal: of ethical standards, the spirit of psychology rampant.
That is the trouble. Too many of the
students have their -interest in the
things which a-man.should come to
college to learn. Too many of them do
not find their work sheer drudgery.”
“But that doesn’t mean that college
spirit is irrevocably predestined to yield
up its place in the lime-light. Let all
the college courses be made ‘uninterest
ing, stereotyped and routine, so that |}
they require as little original thought | |

and as much drudgery as possible on the

part of the student, let all the books in|}
the library, excepting text books, be 1

thrown into the harbor, and I’ll guarantee that within a few. years Dal will

display such an exuberance of college 1

spirit as will put to shame the biggest
education mills in the land.”

For several minutes they sat in
silence.

“That's all bunk,” burst out the||

first student.
“G'wan, you're full of balloon juice.”’

That's a nice way to. show your|}

college spirit, talking like that," pronounced the third.

The conversation again relapsed.
Then he, with an ironical smile flickering about the corners of his mouth, and
they with contemptuous sniffs, rose up,
paid their checks, and departed.

MOON-SHADOWS

 

Like witches walking
While the white moon rides
Are the tall pine trees
On the high hillsides.

Dark hair wind-tossed,
Bodies gaunt and grim,
Thin arms reaching out
As if their eyes were dim.

But the moon rides on

In her silver car

And the poor pine witches
Ghostly shadows are.

in the red mud that lines the Bay, for
the doubtful pleasure of a few clams and
a stiffness in the muscles that lasts a
week, he is not a true lover of Nova
Scotia!

Dr. MacMechan, then, is a _ real
Ultima Thulian, without the modesty
about Nova Scotia which a native
must needs adopt. His book is full of
the tang of the sea wind, the swish of
the waves, the scent of the mayflower
and of the apple blossom, in a word, of

‘hing, to wallow | the spirit of Nova Scotia.

HOCKEY
Although the history of the Dal

hockey team for the past season is, in the

tht of victories and honours attained,
almost a featureless one, there is the

‘yery apparent fact present that the

ee

team improved wonderfully and with a
few additions should be a far classier

Early in the year they lost several

of their star players as a result of the

Christmas examinations and the subseq
‘uent ruling of the faculty regarding the

students who got ploughed. Despite
this handicap they improved steadily
and under the capable management of
Eddie Murray and Walter MacKenzie
and the fruitful coaching of Harry
Butler they managed to turn in a couple

‘of victories near the close of the season

as well as a better brand of hockey.
They played a very strong game against
the U. N. B. sextette and wound up their
season's activities with a better record
than was at first expected of them.
Although this year’s team was not of
senior calibre the addition of several
students barred by _ Intercollegjate rules and others barred! by the
faculty together with a few ‘‘finds”’
amongst the new students may result

j\in the formation of a first class sextette

next year.

Lack of funds is going to be a handicap for the management. If the team
can only make some money for itself
next year things will take on a much
brighter aspect. To do this considerable improvement must be shown.
Everything considered there is great
chance for the hockey future of Dal
growing to former heights within the
next few years. Next fall the Forum
will be available for practiceand the team
should get in a couple of weeks’ practice before the Christmas holidays.
All this counts and there’ only remains
the question of what league to enter.
This depends mostly on the team, but it
would be better to have a fair team in
a senior circuit than a fair team in a
minor circuit. If there is any new
material capable of playing senior hockey
at all there is enough at Dal today to
form the nucleus of a team. This is the
managers job however and we trust
he'll handle the situation in a manner
that will do the most good.

TRACK

Under the managership of Leigh
Miller the Dal Track and Field men
enjoyed one of the best years in the
history of that field of athletics at Dal.
Early in the year the Annual Interfaculty Track and Field Meet brought
to light some good material and from
then on to the close of the Indoor Track
Meets at Dartmouth the Dal colours
were always well represented:’~ = > ~ 
Later in the season the team carried
off the honours in a dual fixture with the

‘Wanderers by the one sided score of

74-22. - The meet did not come up to
expectations but the showing of the Dal
entries left nothing to be desired and
the future of the game at: Dal looks
very promising. In, addition to the

outdoor meets the Dal men also played

a
he

prominent part in the Indoor Sports
d at the Marks Cross Arena, Dartmouth, Although the honours garn
ered by the Yellow and Black were
chiefly the result of Leigh Miller's
efforts the other entries did very well
against stiff opposition and with the
close of the season came the end of one
of Dal’s most successful years in that
phase of athletics.

INDUSTRIAL DAMSELS CAPTURE
CHAMPIONSHIP

 

On March nineteenth the championship of the Halifax Intermediate Girls’
Basketball League was decided in the

: To Simpson’s Go-Getters
goes the honor of being the Intermediate Champions of Nova Scotia.
The victory was well earned but not
gained without a strong effort.

The first period opened with a rush
and things brightened up immediately.
The Dal girls rushed through and
piled up a score. The game looked
good for Dalhousie and Isabel Wood
continued running in baskets. Dal
had many penalties called but Simpson’s failed to take advantage of the
opportunities for scoring. The first
period ended with a score of 13—7 in
favor of Dalhousie. |

The second period started off fast
and Dal was prepared for a come-back.
They were not disappointed and Simpson’s made a great bid for the cup and
championship. Play continued for
about five minutes without any scoring.
The game became tense and just then
‘one of Simpson's forwards put in a
beautiful basket from centre floor.
Dal girls were tired and the strain
proved too great. The team became
desperate and inaccurate shooting on
Dal’s part was plentiful for the rest
of the period. The score was creeping
up and finally Simpson’s tied the
eighteen points made by Dal. The
spectators became wild and just then
one of Simpson’s players got the ball
and it was carried down to the star
forward. In the last ten seconds the
winning basket was scored and just
as the whistle blew the ball rolled through
the basket. The final score was 20—18
in favor of the Go-Getters.

Line-up: centres: M. MacDonald,
E. Cameron. Forwards: B. Freeman,
T. Wood, Guards: L. Barnstead, P.

Miller.

There is the inevitable triangle in

‘The Big Parade,” the King Vidor ||

production for Metro - GoldwynMayer coming next week to the Majestic Theatre, but with a difference.
The two female angles of this triangle
never meet and are for the most part
unaware of each other's existence.

The one is the girl John Gilbert
|leaves behind him when he goes to
war, and the other is a peasant girl
of France. Claire Adams has the
role of the hero’s boyhood sweetheart, and Renee Adoree plays Melisande, the young French woman. An
exceedingly unusual ending is a feature
of the story of ‘‘The Big Parade.”
