the sincere wish that they
will enjoy their stay at Dalhousie and at the other
universities in Canada.

Novel Debate Tonight

A situation probably without parallel
in Sodales debating history exists in
connection with this evening’s debate
in the Forrest Buiiding, for when Mr.
Speaker takes his chair at 8 p. m., the
speaker to open the debate will be
mone other than one who sat in
the Nova Scotian House of Assembly for three years, during which
period the historic Legislative Coun
cil—the Provincial Upper House—
passed from existence.

And the resolution: ‘“‘That this
House favors the abolition of the
Senate.’’

Alex O’Handley, popular second
year law student, and Vice-President
of the Law Society, has the unusual
record for a college student, of having
first sat in a Parliament. In June
1925, he was elected to the House
here, with the late Hon. J. C. Douglas,
representing Cape Breton East. He
retired from political life shortly before the 1928 General Election, and
entered the Law School. In the spring
of '28 he witnessed the passing of the
Upper House; and tonight he moves
the resolution in the ‘‘House,’’—that
it go on record as favoring senate
abolition.

How Many Can You Answer

Geraldine Simms, who entered Dal
last fall as a freshie-junior, from the
Convent of the Sacred Heart. Miss
Simms has never spoken at Sodales,
although she has had considerable
experience at school.

Opposing them will be Binney Fairbanks, Law ’30, and Miss Jean
Leshe, Arts °30. Fairbanks is not
known to present Sodales audiences,
and it may surprise many to know that
he is an ex-Secretary. Binney took
his first two years of law in '25-Z7, and
in "26-7 was Secty of Sodales. He left
Dal for two years and did some ranching on the wild prairies of this fair
Dominion. He will graduate this spring. All Pine Hill are turning out to
hear him tonight.

Jean Leslie is a resident of the Hall,
and first Vice-President of Delta Gamma, whose duties include the management of Giris’ Debating. Miss Lesiie
entered Dal in '28 atter two years at
the U. of B. C., and last year appeared
in a Sodales debate on the benefit of
lectures to the average mortal. She
is a fluent speaker and we understand
many of the Hallers will be on hand
to cast their vote.

| With Mr. O'Handley, will be Miss

| Versus J. Pr. Cc,

The Editor, Dal Gazette.

Dear Sir:

In your last issue you published an
article ‘On Statistics’ signed J. F. C.
it appears that the Gazette had made
the suggestion that a Commerce graduate might find employment as a statistician. J, C. was immediately
inspired to disagree and that in turn
compelled me to disagree with J. F. C.
which I now seek to do in the kindest
possible way.

Now Mr. Editor, I do not propose
to suggest anything for a Commerce
student's career and am quite content
to let J. F. C. or anybody else cast
aspersions and proper battleground
tor the heavy artillery of a B. Comm.
But I do suggest that the peculiar
idea of ‘statistics’ and their merit
advanced by the right worthy writer
of that noteworthy article is at least
a bit warped. |

‘Statistics’ in the popular sense
means information expressed numerically. If J. F. C, meant his scathing
denunciation of statistics to apply to
all statistics | fear our disagreement
is going to be great. If he merely
meant that some statistics, to wit
those compiled and published by the
Government monthly or annually, are
worthless, our disagreement will take
a milder form. 1 choose to believe that
J. F. C. is reasonabie and consequently
asked his question in the latter sense.
Having settied that to my own satis1action | shall now suggest an answer.

The Government couects and compiles a great volume of statistical
information about the State. This is
does largely in its own interests for the
same reason that a good business
executive seeks to acquire accurate
information about his business. That
compilation is the big job and it is
necessary in general and may be so in
detail. The Government then publishes the information and gives it a
limited circulation. And J. F. C. asks
‘What good does it do us?’ Not a
deuce ot a lot—unless we happen to be
concerned with some particular field
about which those Government statistics give information. Then we may
want it in a hurry, and be prepared to
accept it gratis. ‘The extent to whichthe Government is justified in circular
tion is determined by the extent to
which the information is or may be
used. The reason the Government
spends money on statistics is that those
statistics are the most suitable form for
conveying the information that those
whom it concerns find interesting, not
to say edifying.

Futility of a
B. ee Degree

The Editor of the Dalhousie Gazette:

Dear Mr. MacIntosh:—

The significance of an article published last year and entitled ‘The
Futility of a B. A. Degree,” was brought
home to me this week in a most unexpected fashion.

It was at one of those gatherings,
where the drawing-room musicians
have to be dragged unwillingly to the
piano, exclaiming that they can’t play,
that they haven't played for months,
that they have no music sheets with
them, when we knew sorrowfully that
they did mean to play, that nothing
in the world would keep them from the
instrument, that they had music galore
and that they were inwardly rejoicing
—it was at one of these delightful
parties that I met him,

He knew I was a Dal student and
the hostess had told me that he intended
entering the University in the fall.
Finding that we had some interest in
common, we chatted quite pleasantly
and almost forgot the music and the
gloomy atmosphere it produced.

So you are taking an Arts course,”
he said after a pause. I nodded and
waited for him to continue,

“Well, there won't be any Arts
course for me, I'm going into Science,
I like it better because Science is exact
and concise. You have to concentrate
so much more in your work. Funny,
but I always liked to be exact—either
There’s no use in being
a half-way person like some of the
Arts students Iknow,”

The hostess then came up and the
conversation drifted into other chan
 

Ss.
As I walked home that night, the
boy’s words kept ringing in my ears—
concise, exact, half-way person, smatter
ng—

Much as I disliked to do so,I had to
admit that this Grade XII student's
words had struck home, and at the
same time I experienced a sinking
feeling of interiority.

Eight or nine months before entrance,
he hasalready a definitely fixed objective before him—an aim for which he is
going to strive,

He won’t take Arts at Dalhousie.
Arts to him is but a smattering of this
and that. Science he says will teach
him to concentrate—will give him something definite to work for. Science will

 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
   
  
   
  
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
  
   
  
  
  
  

give him the proper drill. It -will
point out the road that must be followed and the objective that must be

reached. One road and one objective.
_ The -way man can’t deal in
electrons.

And we are the half-way people, for
are we not without a fixed direction or
aim, and don’t we believe in the doctrine of the ‘‘good-enough?”

One would seek in vain for “goodenough” in the lexicon of the scientist.

What a horrible thing to realize now
that we have been learning smatterings
of this and that—that we are the half
wayists or indefinitists and that others
are the definitists.

People thought differently once upon
atime, Mr. Eaitor,—

_Halfwayism is losing its hold. Its
solicitous guardians, Philosophy, Classics and Literature are slowly but surely
bowing to a greater master.

Yours sincerely,
J. LOUIS DUBINSKY.

The Library

To the Editor Dalhousie Gazette,
Dear Sir:

As is well known, the Library is
now open every evening in addition to
the regular schedule. Why is it then
that many do not avail themselves of
this opportunity? The value of a
Library does not lie in the newness of
its walis, but in the amount of wear
and tear shown on the linoleum. Judging the success of our Library by the
above criterion, we must agree that the
Dal Library has ampie room for improvement. The trouble lies either
in the students or in the system the
Library is toliowing.

‘Lhe successtui student is not one who
has passed an Economics Exam while
at College, but one who has acquired
a reading habit. At Cambridge University one is not asked ‘‘What are you
studying’’’ but one is asked a more
inteuigent guestion, ‘“‘What are you
reading?’ it is not necessary to go
ito a discussion on their merits of
reading, for are we not agreed with
Muton that ‘A good book is the precious Life blood of a Master Spirit?”
Students then, ought to discard the
idea that Libraries are edifices for the
Honor Student, that they are filling
Stations for fountain pens, or that
they are central depots for the distribution of Gazettes. They are primarily intended for the purpose of
affording us a chance of spending a
few odd moments in reading those
books which interest us, not for the
sake of getting through an examination, but tor their own sake.

But what does one see on entering
the Library? Suppose you have one
hour to spare for reading. At present
you may spend your time wading
through two large cabinets in order
to find the book that may interest you.
lf at the end of that time you are fortunate enough to find the number, and
still have five minutes left you have
a chance to be toid that the book is out.
Is there wonder that students are
discouraged? But then there always
the opportunity of looking in the open
shelves for a book that may interest
you. The following are some of the
books exhibited on the open shelves
and upon which you may shower your
precious time. You may perhaps enjoy reading twenty volumes of “Arcana
Coelestia,'’’ or some of the hundreds of
volumes of Greek Classics exhibited
or even read Fishers ‘‘Making of Index
Numbers."’ Here is where the fault
lies, Evidently the majority of the
students do not delight in reading books
of this nature which are so profusely
exhibited on the open shelvesin the
Library. Surely it can be readily
seen that if interesting and useful
books were placed on the open shelves,
available for inside reading without
the procedure of answering pink,
blue or yellow questionnaires, students
would not spend as many idle moments
talking to their friends as they are
forced to do now. By interesting and
useful books are meant Contemporary
Fiction, Verse, Non Fiction and what
have you? Surely the Library has
been buying some books on Current
Publications, then why not show them?
In addition to the plan of Open Shelves
laden with readable books, the staff
could issue a typed list of all the New
Books received every month.

In closing may it be added that these
carping criticisms are not showered on
so important an institution unless they
are written for the sole purpose of
making the Library what it ought to be.
Action Please!

may have all been wrong. I regret,
however, that your correspondent felt
it prudent to choose this debate as a
direct example of incompetent judging.

Censors Gazette

The Editor,
The Dalhousie Gazette.

Dear Sir:—

university paper to the discussion of
the increased Council fee . However,
I feel that you are to be censured on
one or two points in regard to this
matter.

To a: reader, on picking up the
particular issue of the Gazette to which
I refer, the first impression is that the
Gazette is very, very much in favor
of the increased fee. The many and
varied two column heads scattered
through the paper testify to that.
Now Mr. Editor, I am well aware that
the matter of an increased fee has been
mentioned as a part of the program of
our paper for Dalhousie for 1930.
However, this matter is a most contentious one, and hardly one for the
Gazette to come out and take a definite
stand on. Now, bear in mind Mr.
Editor, I do not mean to insinuate for
a moment that the members of the
Gazette staff are not to have a say in
this important discussion. Most certainly they shall have—are they not
students of Dathousie and rightly deserving of the privilege of expressing
their views? Certainly they are; but
in the proper manner. What | mean
to say is this. The Dalhousie Gazette
is the students’ paper, the organ of
Daihousie University, and as such is as
much my paper as it is the next chap’s.
The stati ot the Gazette are appointed
to look after the interests of each and
every student of the university to the
prejudice of no one.

Now Mr, Editor, do you honestly
feel that, beyond the fact that you
believe or do not believe personally
that the student body would benefit
by an increased fee, you are serving
best the interests of those who intrusted
you with your position when you permit boid, black face articles on such a
controversial subject to be published
in the Gazette unsigned?

You must be well aware, yourself,
from previous experience that it is an
unwritten rule in journalistic ethics
that no article criticising or contentious
in character is permitted to appear in
the columns of a newspaper, other
than the editorial columns, unless it
bears some inkling as to the identity
of the writer. Now, I have before
me the issue of the Gazette of February 4th. 1930, in which I find eight
articles on the question of aten dojlar
fee. Four of these are signed by the
writers, one other is written under a
pen-name for reasons better known to
the author, and three others acknowledge no author whatsoever.

Now, Mr. Editor, every bit of mater
ial which appears in the Gazette, with

You are to.be more or less compli-| the exception of the advertising, is

mented’ on the generous spirit with
which you donated the columns of the

\f THE STUDENT

_ DALHOUSIE UNIVERSITY
_ The last issue of the Gazette con.
tains a notice of the proceedings of the

Students’ Council of Friday last, con
cerning a proposed raising of the fee
from $7 to $10 for student activities.
_ Many influential persons are urging
this, for reasons best known to themselves. Others however, would rather
leave things as they are. Sufficient
information has not been given out, and
a bene number are hesitating for this
_ reason. em
_ An increased fee does’ not necessarily
mean “Bigger and Better college ac
_tivi fies.’ Dalhousie was able to send

was raised from $5 to $7 the hockey
team has not increased it’s prestige,
- but rather has lost it, as the older
students well know. The Glee Club
and the Gazette are dependent upon the
energy and the intellect put into them,
and not upon the money that may be
ig granted.
Promises about free games, etc.,
may be taken with a grain of salt
_ The same promise was given when the
fee was raised from $5 to $7, but it
~  hasneverbeen fulfilled. |
With the previous increase the
Council had more money than it
actually needed. Older students will
- yemember the extravagences—‘'$100
for lemons,” for instance.
_—s What about Kings? Has any arran- gement been arrived at, for them to
cae je a part of the expense? At first
__ the Kings students paid fees. Is it
~~ now the intention that Dalhousie
students alson shall bear the burden?
‘Who is responsible for this? Wny so
much reticence?
It would be well to attend the
meetings when your representatives

these facts, and not allow the student
body to be stampeded into supporting

The World’s Language
Problem

 

The solving of the world’s language
Problem is a very difficult matter.
from time to time one hears of different plans. Today the world is
thinking about a universal language
and looxs to the talking pictures and
the radio as a means of solving this
problem,

two languages are proposed as

likely contenders for the world’s uni- |

versal language, ‘hese are Esperanto
and Engusna, Lhe main argument for
tsperanto is that it is not the language
spoken by any of the nations today,
and hence it would destroy any opposition rising against it from the
point of view of Nationalism, A
great - many things can be said-against
isperanto as a world language. Although Esperanto might pe adopted
various nations by virtue of its tascimating resemblance to the numerous
world ianguages, yet one must remember that in nearly every instance
it Will be an entirely new language to
its students. A new language is not
an easy thing to learn, more especially
when this danguage is not one spoken
by any large group of people teday.

. kngush scems to have tar better
claim to universality than Esperanto
er any toreign language. It is spoken
by about one-fortn ot the peopies of
the worid today. ‘The natural trend
in foreign countries is towards English
because English is the chief language
ot commerce today. The main argument against Engiish will arise from
the point of view of nationalism.
Sooner or later the foreign nations of
the world will recognise the ever
spreading influence of the English
language and their national consciousness will be aroused. A tendency
might be for the English speaking
peoples to become haughty and arrogant, a superiority teeling which
the other nations will surely resent.
Aroused by these things they will
clamor for a return to their own native
tongue and for the retention of the
same. Hence one may rest assured
that the foreign nations will prefer to
retain their native tongues and exchange theirs for any other world
language.

trom these contentions it will be
seen that bit ishardly likely for either
Esperanto or English to become a
universal language. Since these two
languages have greater claims towards
universality than other world languages,
it also means that a universal language
is not a possible reality.

The advocation of a_ universal
language is a renewed suggestion made
by the talking-picture and radio industries. They saw in the adoption of
a universal language the simplification
of their own difficulties. A universal
language would place the large scale
producer at an advantage over the
small producers. This is another argument against a universal language
which the other producing countries
will be quick to see. From the standpoint of trade, no nation will allow, if
it can possibly help it, another nation

the monopoly in the manutacture and| N

production of any articles.

Since a universal language is doomed
from a consideration of all these things,
there remains the further consideration
of the language problem. With each
nation striving to produce talking
pictures and to arrange radio programs for their communities, one sees
a distinct trend towards the populanization of the foreign languages of
the world. For the talking pictures
and radio will traverse the seven seas
and one will have the opportunity of
studying foreign nations by remaining
at home. A new high peak of culture
will be established. This standard of
culture will-include the ability to understand the other nations of the
world and their place in this Universe.
