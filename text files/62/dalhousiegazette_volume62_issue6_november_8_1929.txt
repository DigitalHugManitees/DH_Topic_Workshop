~The Oldest College Paper in America extends a welcome and
congratulations to ‘The Newest College Paper in America.”
A Last week The Chesshire Pussy made its appearance at Shirreff
‘Hall and from all reports it seems to have been well received. No
one knows who are the editors of this new sheet but one gathers
from looking over the first edition that whoever they are, they
‘certainly must have Job’s patience and Sina Singer’s energy to
copy out so many columns of thousands of words in long hand.
Might we add here that the editors could rid themselves of all this
trouble by depositing their masterpieces of diction and composition
in the Gazette boxes, (which are strategically located in the Library
and Forrest Building) and we shall see that the copy is turned into
neat printed type.

Welcome fellow scribblers! We are glad to see that the Hall
has such splendid writing talent. We hope that you will not
hide your light but let the rest of the college benefit by it—give

iu it to us—that we may give it to others—“Our aim is to give light.”

(ae, t., | RECKLESS DRIVING

Several students have brought to the attention of the Gazette
| the manner in which other students and members of the Faculty
) drive their cars around the University grounds.

[e The roadways leading to the Forrest Building and the Studley
buildings are for the use of pedestrian students as well as those
who are fortunate enough to be able to drive to and from classs

‘ by car. Sidewalks are not provided and recklessness on this road
E will some day cause an accident which could have been easily
ie avoided had the motorist executed a reasonable amount of care.

a. _ The rules governing driving on the Nova Scotia highways

“8 provincial highway is “common sense and courtesy.'’ Let every

 

Dalhousie motorist adopt this theme when on the campus, at least,

DALHOUSIE GAZETTE

- Shows Progress.

Live Organization Looks Forward

to Success
ful Year.

 

The Sigma Theta Pi Sorority was
formed during the college year of
1928-29 with Alice Nelson as President,
The need for such a society had been
felt for some time, and it was with a
feeling of great satisfaction that. the
charter members were able to conclude
their preparations and become known
publicly: as an organized body after
Xmas. Tne necessity for such a
body was also felt by other students
as was evidenced by the appearance of
another sorority at about the same period an the term. The unexpected
announcement of sororities on the
campus aroused quite a bit of ill feeling
which, we are glad to say has almost
entirely subsided. We all realize now
that sororities are a permanent feature
of Dalhousie co-educational life. The
present Sigma Thetas feel sure that
as the years go on there will be no
regrets amongst the student body that
the ice for sorities was broken in 1928.

Just a word of warning to Freshettes
—do not be too hasty in making your
decisions as to wnich sorority to join.
The old adage ‘Look before you leap”’
still holds true.

The Sigma Thetas wish to thank
Mrs. C. Wilson Smith for the lively
interest she has shown and for having
gotten us well under way last year.

To enable outsiders to become acquainted with our members a short
sketch of eacn is given below:

Alice Nelson, ever vivacious, who
scored such a hit in ‘The Show Off”
and other features at Glee Club being
Vice-Pres., last year was our former
President. She is now at her home
in Stewiacke.

Diversity Of
Co-Eds.

Not so many years ago it was quite
a novelty for a girl to consider taking
a college education; the narrow-minded raved on about woman's place
being in the home, and what did a
woman want to be learned for anyhow-—
Gradually it eame to be the accepted
thing for girls to take college subjects.
Then the subject of Co-Education
began to raise its head, and there has
been—for that matter, there still is—
a lot of discussion on this question.
However, that may be, the girls still
keep flocking to colleges. Not so long
after, the fair sex was not content with
merely getting a Bachelor of Arts,
degree, but decided to keep up with the
men. Consequently, we find that
there have been enrolled at Dalhousie,
women students in every department
except Engineering. The one Department outside of Arts, whish has the
largest female registration, is of course
Science; the girls seem to have been
very successful in this branch of study.
The department of Commerce is very
rapidly gaining favour with the women,
perhaps so that they can keep a closer
rein on the purse strings after they
marry. The study of Medicine should
always interest the fair sex, since they
are- supposed to want to look after
everybody. This must be true, at
least in part, because there have been
many girls graduate in Medicine at
Dalhousie. There have not been so
many in the faculty of Dentistry although the few that have tried it have
made a success of it. Now in Law,
the women are finding that after all,
they may have powers of persuasion
and logic never before dreamed of,
because so many of the so-called superor males have gone down before their
arguments, Pharmacy, a comparatively new branch as Dalhousie, has also

had its intricacies explained to the

inquisitive female mind. Now who
vill deny that Co-Eds are diversified?

MY VIEWS OF CO-EDUCATION.

Co-education! Ah, the many things
which occur to one at the mention of
that word!! Picture a young, verdant
Freshman, with, let us suppose, normal
re-actions to the subtle influence of
Eros, entering a co-educational institution for the first time. He is resolved
to labour diligently, and carvea secure
niche for himself, in the scholastic
hall of fame, But, (alas, sad to tell)
Fate has decreed otherwise. In his
first class, he sits as in a dream, enthralled, not because of the Lecturer,
but because of a pink and white blonde,
with heavenly blue eyes and a fascinating smile. This ethereal’ creature
sits across the aisle from him three
times a week, and is the substance of
every lecture for our little Freshman,
But, enough of this lugubrious picture!
We all know the fate of him who fell.
He returns home at Xmas, ‘ploughed
in five,’ a mere shadow of his former
self, educational prospects ruined!

What now is the cause of all this‘Tis our old friend, ‘the disturbing
female influence.” Yes, it is this
insidious (—) force which has spelled
the rufm of many, for such is the biological construction of man. Let us in
future resolve to remove temptation
from the way of the frollicsome freshman, the jaunty junior and the selfsatisfied senior.

The women- Ah, God bless all of
‘em, but keep ‘em away when we are
trying to study!!

THOMAS A GOUDGE.

 

Co-Education

No education is complete without at
least some attempt being made to
understand the most mysterious and
comples problem the world can offer
to harass our over-wrought brain,
namely, one of the opposite sex. The
male students of any university should
realize what a priceless opportunity
is theirs to study at first hand for four
years or more this engrossing subject.

Sure, we want co-education. Why
if there were no girls at Dalhousie
what would poor, old Dr. Todd do for
excitement in the Lab! How would
the student spend all his money without some fair-haired co-ed to help him(We only say fair-haired because gentlemen prefer blondes).

And of course the co-eds must have
something to say as to how the college
is run. I think, though, that they
should elect their own representatives
to the Students’ Council, from their
own societies. Then we wouldn't find
a co-ed voting for a male student
because he possessed such lovely blue
eyes or a male student voting for a
co-ed because of her possession in
abundant quantities of the mysterious
quality called “‘it,”’

A. GORDON COOPER.

 

Too Many Lines
Busy

Despite the valiant efforts of the brave little
“Half Pint’’ last year, the
University is still cursed
an antiquated telephone
system that requires the
aid of a good detective,
several messengers and
finally a personal visit, for
the transmission of a message from any telephone
in the City to someone at
the University.

With every large concern
equipped with a private
branch exchange it is disgraceful that the University retains, with conservative determination an, obsolete, unwieldy, and inconvenient service.

 

Unreality

When I was a little boy, I was taught
that the world—this wonderful earth
and its vast seas—was made by God.
In answer to my question as to who the
great God was, and why I could not
see Him, I was told that I must never
doubt the existence of the Supreme
Being. He was here, there and everywhere. He was the Almighty, the
All-knowing and the Great Creator of
Heaven and Earth. All of Nature’s
great phenomena were explained as
the handiwork of the great God. The
Sun, the Moon, the Stars, Thunder,
Lightning, Fire and all things which
seemed shrouded in mystery were explained in terms of the Supreme Power.

As I grew up, in my search for knowledge, 1 ventured in the fields of science.
Science was the only reasonable guide
to Nature. Through Science, I hoped
to learn something of this Infinite
world, and to the causes of some of
Dame Nature’s astounding handiworks.

Spiritual thinking seemed too abstract in contrast to scientific thought.
One.was entirely imaginative, whilst
the other seemed distinctly real. Looking at explanations from a scientific
point of view, the reality of things
seemed far too strong an argument
against unreality.

Scientific reasoning kept me, then,
strictly in the path of all things real
and material. Every phenomena was
explained by means of some real cause.
This search for explanation led one
from material, obvious and real things
to very minute insignificant atoms.
Later the trail led back from the atom
to the electrom, carrying me into a
further sea of mystery. The electron
borders on the-brink of reality and unreality. Now the trail is leading me
from the reality of the electron to an
infinite reality, which most likely
seems nothing but unreality,

College Brief.
Gertie at Acadia.
Gertrude Phinney, famous former
Dalhousian, is now attending Acadia
University, where she is taking the

Household Science course. She was
in the city for the Dal-Acadia game.

 

 

Visited Here.
Mary Rogers, who was at College
last year, was visiting at the Hall.

Page ‘‘Big Jim.’’

Marg Mackie, and other Commerce
students, mildly, insane, pay frequent
visits to the Board of ‘Trade, Chronicle
Office, Jail, and other institutions.
For the reason page ‘Big Jim.”’

Visited by Mother.

Margaret MacLean’s mother was at
the Hall for the week-end. She left
with less than she brought. But then
Shirreff Hall girls are noted for their
dieting!!!

Westhaver’s opinion.

Westhaver has been airing his opinion of prohibition, etc. He said ‘‘As
Thursday is voting day, we are all
going tofreeze and starve that day.”
‘‘For,’’ says Westhaver, ‘‘we have to
vote, and you girls are not of much
importance anyway.”

The Poor Bird.

Wednesday morning about nine
o'clock shrieks arose from Frankie
Elkins room ‘Girls, come here quick.’
No more was needed Mackie rushed in,
as a bird flew out of Frankie’s room into
tha hall. The corridor resounded with
yells. Poor bird! Mar finally captured it, and gently put it out of th
window.

Poor Peg.

Peg was very busy, when she heard
Helen say, ““Peg, come here. I have
something to tell you."’ Peg dropped
everything and came. Helen, “Peg
if you came this far for nothing how
far would you go for a quarter-”
There was silence, for as everyone
knows Pegs has joined the anti-cuss
league.

They need it.

A number of girls have decided that
too much time and money is being
spent at the barbers. So these girls,
hoping to increase their wealth, have
established an exclusive beauty shop
on the top floor of the Hall. The
pass word is “‘pins,”’

Al’s Flying Visit.

Al’s flying visit. A horn is heard
outside.. Immediately every ‘window
has its occupant. A glimpse of Al.
Shrieks, Slams, and Al appears in the
Hall. There are cries of ‘Hello, Al,”
and then... “Bye, everyone,”’ and Al
has departed after paying another
minutes visit to the Hall.

 

Little had I thought when leaying
the wilds of imaginative thought, and
all unreality, and seeking the path
explanation in reality, that I would
be led back to an inexplainable and
impenetrable forest—the dark and
mysterious forest of Unreality.

its WRITTEN in the MOST PERfect

you because the WHOLe first two
PARagraphs are taken up with a
description of how ROLPH Grant
looked on the FIELD and how BIG
and STRONG and HANDSOME he is
and that is REALLY the most IMportant part of the GAME don’t you
think—- [I MEAN its all very well to
SAY what the SCORE is and all THAT
BUT don’t you think the SPORT
editor in the GAZette overDOES
things when he describes the PLAY—
don’t you HONestly think they should
DEscribe the MEN in STEAD- BUT
of COURSE I don’t think we should
comPLAIN because the EDitors have
been having such a BUSY time lately
hunting TREASures in GRAVE yards
and getting FREE cigarettes at SORority TEAS that they wouldna’t KNOW
a GOOD story if they SAW one—anyway I SENT some perfectly good

you think, 1 MEAN everybody looked

In making the choice of a life-mate,

oe periene instead of being tuned to

charms on the other fellow, Yes,
_ there is our second classification, ‘‘The
other fellow’s girl.” Isn’t it a crying
shame to see such a lovely example of
the sex waste her abilities and her
opportunities on such an inferior brand
of male as “that other chap.” Truly
her mentality must be far below normal
when she would turn to him with you
available. Again I say “Oh, the
conceit of we males.”’
(3) There may be (and I say it
not without great thought) a few
lovely examples of them who care not
about male attractiveness. If there
are such they would make a third
classification. We naturally do not
wish to think that any such exist and
perhaps sometimes by their actions
we are led to be assured of such a
belief but I can hear the sweet things
now joining in the chorus, “Oh! the
conceit of you males,”
(4) The last classification is one I
hate to mention, really its distressing
to think that around us in daily college
life we can see so many examples of
this classification. For years we males
dominated the professional fields and
in our own braggard manner used to
exclaim ‘“The home for the woman,”
But she became emancipated and
took upon herself our tasks and found
that she could do and do as well as we
could the tasks of our man—closed professional life. And today I can see
her perhaps turning her head to hide
her smile from us, saying to her fellowsisters, ‘Oh, the conceit of these males,”

Now that I have so carefully classi
fied them and I believe in fered classification pointed out the various fallacies
in our modes of thinking about them
there just remains for me to draw
some conclusion and cease trying to
make a case for us,
My only conclusion can _ possibly
be best stated in the words of the
mother administering the. castor oil
to the small boy who is objecting because he does not like it,

She grabs him ey by the nose
and forcing it down his throat exclaims ‘There now, you will take it
and you will like it.”

So with the ladies, We will watch
them usurp our basic rights and powers
watch them replace us at our especially
_ appointed tasks, watch them rise and
rise higher in the influencing of world
_ affairs and retiring behind our books
we will “light up” and console ourselves with the words of Kipling:
_ “A&A woman’s always a woman,
But a good cigar is a smoke."’

First Team leaving tonight for Fredericton
and Saint John

a*The Dalhousie first team is planning
to leave on a well deserved trip on
Friday evening and plans have been
completed for the Tigers to engage the

day, and the Fredericton City team
on Monday. The boys have been

ractising faithfully and although their
hard city league schedule has not yet
been completed, it is generally felt that

season will do the boys a lot of good.

Then again it will be very interesting
to seé just how our representatives
compare with two such well known
New Brunswick teams. Should the

Tigers defeat these two teams, the|Shirreff Hall which houses the non-resident University

rugby as played in that section of the
country is superior to that played in
fhe Halifax City League. |

All in all it should be a very successful
trip, both from the stand-point of
deciding just where Dal stands when
compared to her neighbours, and also
of providing a very pleasant break
for the boys who have worked so hard
to place Dal at the top of the city
League.

The coaches have not as yet announced the players who will make the trip,
but it is sate to say that they will have
a strong team on hand, which will do
its best tor Dal.
