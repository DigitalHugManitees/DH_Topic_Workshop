How and where shall University dances be |

held? That is the question which has engaged the attention of the Students’ Council
during the past few weeks. Rules and
regulations concerning dancing at Dalhousie
have been sent down from the Senate to the
‘es the itt amon has been closed to
ding a settlement of the details
of iinbidateadlen and enforcement of University ations; committees have met and
diseussed the matter, and finally a committee
from the Senate met the whole Countil on
Thursday, November 8. .
At this conference the members of the
Senate Committee on Dancing, Dr, Nichols,

on the ground that such a rule is unnecessary
and could not be effectively enforced.

At a Senate meeting held at noon on Thursday, Nov. 15, the report of the Committee on
Dancing was heard and a new draft of regulations (the third) was approved. This draft
was presented to the Council at an emergency
meeting the same evening. It is modelled
generally along the lines of the modified plan
as submitted by the Council on Nov 8, and,
with the exception of one clause, was
approved. This clause provides that the
University name shall not be applied to any
dances held elsewhere than on the University
premises,

While the Council recognized the desirability of holding University dances in the gymnasium, and expressed themselves as willing
to facilitate and encourage the use of the
gymnasium for such dances, yet the Council
did not feel justified in surrendering the
privilege which the student body now has of
holding University dances outside of Dalhousie premises. Therefore the Council,
after considerable discussion, decided to ask
the Senate to reconsider this clause.

The Senate has exhibited a desire to meet
the student body half way, and the negotiations as a whole will probably result in a
substantial, if not a complete solution of a
difficult problem.

 

Congratulations to Henry Borden, Nova

Seotia’s Rhodes Scholar for 1924.

The -Re-opening of Tomb ; of King. Tut-ankh

  

The news of the discovery of the tomb of
‘King Tut-ankh-amen last November created
quite an unwonted stir amongst Egyptologists. .And with good reason, for he is the
only. pharoah whose burial chamber has been
‘found intact. It is a remarkable fact, that
‘these autocratic monarchs, supreme egotists
call of them, were not permitted to rest in
‘peace within the magnificent tombs they had
carefully prepared for themselves during
their life times. With this one exception,
they were all plundered by tomb robbers
many centuries ago, and their priceless
funerary furnishings either carried off or
ruthlessly destroyed The ante-chambers of
‘Tut-ankh-amen’s tomb displayed evidences of
having being entered by robbers after his
interment, but the sanctuary within which
he was committed to the care of his gods still
exhibited the seals stamped upon the wall by
the officiating priests at the time of his
funeral.

Within the next few days, perhaps by- the
‘ime these words appear in print, the gorgeus sanctuary of blue faience and gold inlay
work in which the kingly body is enclosed
will be opened, and there on a royal catafalque,
after the lapse of thirty two centuries, the
mummified body of the only pharoah, reclaimed untouched, will be found.

No tomb in this world will have been
entered with more reverence and tender care,
and we will soon be enabled to study in the
‘fullest detail the exact way
‘pharoahs were immured. The explorers have
no intention of removing him, but will permit his remains to lie in the exact position
‘in which they have rested since those far off
dim ages, when he was placed in his sealed
«chamber.

. It is hoped that Tut-ankh-amen’s sepulchre
“will contain papyri and: mural inscriptions,
written in wonderful heiroglyphs, which will

provide a history not only of the King’s.

reign, but also of the dynasties that went
‘before him. ~All these will be translated and
studied carefully in an effort to decipher the
blurred records of these far off times.

To most people these are few thoughts
more repellant than that of desecrating the
dead. This had already been done centuries
ago in the ease of all the pharoahs, with this
-- .gingle exception, Therefore all that remain.ed for Egyptologists to do was to study the

in which the

 

a considerable amount of fresh light on
biblical history, for it is possible’ that the
Israelites were enslaved in Egypt previous to
the time of Rameses the Seeond, a powerful
king of the nineteenth dynasty, who was
particularly zealous in his oppression of that
race, and hence became known as_ the
Pharoah of the Oppression; while his son
Merenptah has generally been regarded as
the Pharoah of the Exodus.

It will be interesting to find out whether the
inscriptions on Tut-ankh-amen’s tomb make
any reference to his father-in-law and predecessor King Akhen-aten, the “heretic
pharoah.’’ The latter is one of the most
interesting personages in history. He overthrew the ancient gods of Egypt and adopted
instead a form of sun-worship. He might
thus be termed the founder of a monotheistic
form of religion. This‘inspires speculation
with reference to the significance of the heiroglyph that represents life or immortality—
the ankh symbol. Thus is in the form of a
cross with the upper limb replaced by a loop,
and it may be noted that the word constitutes
the middle position of Tut-ankh-amen’s
name. Its importance in Ancient Egypt
may be guaged from its constant presence in
mural sculpture, and likewise from the fact
that many of the gods and goddesses are
represented grasping the symbol firmly
in one hand. In ‘the wonderful sculptured
reliefs exhibiting King Akhen-aten engaged
in the worship of the solar disc, the rays are
represented ending in human hands one of
which is holding the sacred ankh symbol
before the king’s face, the idea presumably
being that the life-giving rays of the sun are

conferring upon him the power of existence.

The priests of the god Amen, which was at
that time the most powerful of the ancient
Egyptian deities, were in constant friction
‘with Akhen-aten with reference to his heretical principles, and on his death his

successor Tut-ankh-amen restored the ancient

gods of the country to their previously
exalted positions, and thus returned once
-more to the polytheistic form of religion. It
is significent, however, that Tut-ankh-amen
must have .been..a somewhat vacillating
personage, for his name previous to his accession was Tut-ankh-aten, in tacit approval of
the Aten worship of his powerful father- inlaw. When, at the behest of the priesthood,

In an intreview with the Toronto “Varsity” last
week, “Mr. Bagnall said that when he crossed the
ocean a few weeks ago he had an idea that he
might remain on this side, and perhaps take a
position on the staff of one of the Universities in
the States. It was because of this that he did not
return to England with the other members of the
debating team. The renewed activity in the
English political world occasioned by the stand Mr.
Baldwin has taken in favour of protection, and
the resulting certainty of a general election in the
near future, has caused him to change his plans,
however.

Though he has always taken an active interest
in politics, being a supporter of the Independent
Liberal Party, Mr. Bagnall stated that he had no
idea or running for parliament until a short time
ago, when he received cables from two conflicting
parties—the Independent Liberals and the Lloyd
Georgian Liberals—both asking him to contest
seats in their interests. Mr. Bagnall would not
say much about what has been going on since, but
it is obvious that the wires must have been kept
busy, for, following the receipt of another cable
early this week, he definitely decided to sail for
England and to contest a constituency in the interests of the Georgian party. Jn explaining that
he had not really deserted the Independent Liberals,
and was not standing so much for Lloyd George

as for free trade, Mr. Bagnall allows one to draw

the very interesting inference that the Conservative party will have to fight against a Liberal party
re-united on the question of free trade.”

ANONYMOUS LETTERS.
Out of some fifty letters which we receive for
publication in our.correspondence column during
the year, quite three-quarters are accompanied by
the request that they be published under a pseudonym. We always do as we are requested in this
matter, but we wonder often why the writers do
not wish to sign their names Some letters are
received which are in themselves sufficient explanation for the writer’s self-chosen obscurity. These
are slanderous letters, bitter letters, and silly letters, which do not reach our public. We do not
blame the writers of these for refusing to place
their names beneath them; we only blame them
for ever committing their thoughts to paper.

If a man has opinions which are worth an airing in the public press, he should not be afraid to
give them the authority of his name. Some may
think that their letters will carry more weight if
they are ananymous. These people must be suffering from what we believe psychologists call a
marked inferiority complex. It is an axiom with
newspapers and in all publicity work that a name
is always worth printing,’ People are interested to
know whose views they are reading. When they
see a letter written over a pseudonym their obvious
inference is that the writer is a man who is conscious that his views are wrong, or that he is afraid
to side with a minority. A psendonym, therefore,
weakens the force of a letter, and as the only purpose in writing a letter is to give forceful expression to an opinion, a failure to sign it is a nullification of its purpose. The bashful writer who
wishes to avoid publicity, and who yet feels that
he has opinions which must be expressed, may find
himself in a eer on reading this; but if he
will take our advice, he will set his teeth and stick
out his chin and acknowledge his responsibility for
the statements he makes public,

The habit of sheltering behind anonymity is a
most pernicious one to cultivate. It undermines
the character The destiny of such a one is to
become like Chuchundra, the Indian muskrat of
Rudyard Kipling’s tale, who creeps along the walls
and “whimpers and cheeps all night, trying to
make up his mind to come into the middle of the
room, but he never gets there.”—Toronto Varsity.

 

 

   
  

   

Dalhousie has again been honored by the selec
tion of one of her students as Nova Scotia Rhodes
Scholar ‘for O24. Henry’ Borden of: ‘second : year
Law, is the successful candidate

The selection by the committee is one which met
with the universal approval of the student body.

Henry, or “Gus” as he is familiarly addressed by
his friends, entered the Dalhousie Law School in
1922. He is a native of Grand Pre, the son of
Mr. H. R. Borden, now of Ottawa. He is a nephew of Sir Robert Borden. After spending very
successful years at King’s Collegiate at Windsor,
Henry entered Arts at M¢tGill and graduated in
1921 with honors in Political Sefence. He -then
joined the staff of the Royal Bank of Canada and
remained with that institution until his entrance at
Dalhousie.

His career at Dalhousie has been marked by an
excellent s¢holastic record, with a general participation in athletics and other college activities.
This year he managed the football team which captured the Maritime championship, was secretary
treasurer of the Halifax City League and is also
secretary-treasurer of the Dalhousie Law Society.

The Rhodes Scholarship is awarded for ability
and scholastic attainments, force of character and
capacity for leadership as shown by manhood,
truth, courage, devotion to duty, sympathy for and
protection of the weak, kindliness, unselfishness and
fellowship; and for physical vigor as shown by
fondness of and success in manly outdoor sports.

 

Dentistry has entered a team in the interfaculty Volley ball league, the hours for
practise are from 8,30 till 9.30 Tuesday nights
and on Saturday afternoons, These hours
can also be used for general gym. work
under Mr. Stirling and afford an opportunity
for the Dents who have no available time
throughout the day to keep in condition. See
V. Clifford regarding joining a gym. class or
Earl Green who has.charge of the Volley ball
team. j

Preparations for the ‘‘ Dental Night’’ which
is to be held in the Munro Room next Friday
night are coming along rapidly and the
various contenders for spotlight honors are
practising daily. One number: in particular,
a quartette of ‘‘Dark Horses,’’ promises to
be something out of the ordinary.

THE DALHOUSIE GAZETTE

The Garish Shawl

 

‘*A young man is standing in a room impatiently watching’the door from the hall.

- An inserutable look passes over his face as a

young woman enters, carelessly adjusting a
shawl.’”’

This theme was recently mailed to four of
our leading litterateurs, and the following
are the developments they would have submitted :

As Arnold Bennett Saw It.

Edwin blenched at the sight of the shawl.
The orange-colored gas globes gilded her
shoulders, imperceptibly decolletee through
its delicate pattern, with a maddening effect
on him. .. This woman was conscienceless.
He execrated the shawl. Her . magnificent
easualness told him she was luxuriating in his

exasperation. His anger was furious but
cold. ‘
‘*Who moved this furmiture?’’
eT di4#,’’

‘*Will you persist in making a baby of me
in my own house? Do J go altering furni
ture without consulting you? DoJ do things.

behind your back? Never!’’

‘‘Edwin this is really too much!’’. There
was a touch of mockery in her precise voice.
She passed idly to the piano and began a melody from one of Dvorak’s ‘‘Legends.’’

An inwardly feverish but outwardly calm
desperation seized him. This woman had
clearly scorned the sacredness of the status
quo. It was an attack on vital principles.
Doubtless, she imagined he would accept the
fait accompli. She was mistaken. With
astounding swiftness he set to work to restore
In three minutes not a
trace remained of the fait accompli. In a
glass he saw that, despite his exertions, he was
pale, and one finger bleeding. He moved to~wards the piano.

‘‘Hilda,’’ he said.

She stopped.
“Take off the shawl. I won’t have it, and

At the same time he,thought: ‘‘I was hasty, I may not be quite within my rights.’’

‘What an old fusser you are,’’ she retorted. She silently folded the shawl in her

Jap, and then ,with both hands shut the

‘piano with an irritatingly gentle click... .

Click! He could have killed her for that
_.elick. . . . She seized the shawl.

“TI must go up and look at Freddy.’’ she

‘murmured, with cool, clear calmness.

And the next moment Edwin sank into a

chair and stared at his favorite Bellini.

threw aside the hide-not, and «urned again
to Gert. Anon she murmured, Tancred!”’
and bewhiles a deep sigh rent ' breast, a
rent so deep that she snatched the mantle to
hide her—but there, enough of that.

She then rose and stretched her willowy
form, for Gertie was as graceful as a mededian
of longitude. The very sight of her was a
scene that no one could see undisenraptured.

(jertrude and Tan were in love. But Gerald the Ginfizil, the Gogetter’s father, had
other plans for his jazzy daughier.. lic—
but that’s another story.

The lovers are crouching for another embrace, when—hark! the tramp of Gerald’s
oxfords. Tancred slips out of sight, and
(jertrude sticking her head under some
shrubs, feints sleep. But hardly were they
concealed when the reyolutions of the feet are
heard retreating. A false alarm! (From the
Latin alarum—anglicized. )

Tancred now produces a trinket for Gertrude; a work of art done by his sister, Raschellfrida. It is a string of a string of
pearls. Overcome with spontaneity Gertie
hurls the wash-tub at her lover’s shins in expression of her gratitude. Tancred hids his
flame adieu with a right to the jaw, and the
clandestine meeting is o’er.

Senor Blasco Ibanez.

The maiden shuddered. It was Raphael

there before her, enveloped in a cloak, as pale

as death, his clothes spattered with blackish
blood.
‘Maria de la Lu!_...The mantilla! The

Englishman lies in a pass to Gibralter, dead

as Lucifer and Judas—God’s enemies. The
mastiffs of the Guard think they’ll get me
...-desu! What a joke! The mantilla_--quickly !’’

The wounded matador snatched his prize,
and strove to reach his horse in the yard.
He fell in a heap on the stones, with a smile
of pain disclosing his white, savage teeth.

Webster's Column

The publication of a year book by Dalhousie has been discussed by various groups
of students quite often during the past few

 

years, but as yet nothing has been done. A
year book would provide in a real measure

what the graduation number of the Gazette
has attempted to give, a complete summary
of the year’s doings at Dalhousie with photographs and biographies of the graduates.

The year book has become an institution in
almost évery university on the continent, and
we understand that some of»the high schools
(Pictou Academy, for example) are attempting a year book on a scale that would do jus.
tice to any college.

The editing of such a year book means 
considerable work and would require a complete staff separate from the Gazette. Furthermore, the work must be started at once
to insure a successful issue this year. Let
us get together and have a permanent remembrance of our life at Dalhousie.

 

MY HOME TOWN.

 

I’ve travelled from east to western seas;

I’ve followed the path of the vagrant
breeze ;

There is not a town, there is not a street,

But has seen the print of my restless feet.

There is not a marsh, nor fen, nor lea,
Without a treasure of song for me.
I’ve wandered afar, as I freely own;
Like a vagabond bird, Acolus blown,

And the Four Winds roam less constantly
By cottage and palace and city and sea.
Tho’ I search all the earth, both up and
down,
Yet the dearest place is my own home town.
. —B; I.

Punch With a Kick.

 

 

“The last books of the winter season are creeping out, and some are important and some are
not,” says The D Yhronicle; and this bland
statement leads to break out thus: —

The last books of winter, —
Some slim and some stout,
From the hands of the printer
Are now sing out”;
And it’s helpful t from

A man on the spot
That some are important
And others are not.

‘sudden a shuffle of slippers sounded outside
and a muffled ‘“‘Shucks’’. There seemed to
be something permeating the closed door.
Well of all things! There he was in the
-semi-darkness, the stiff pompadour tinged
with gray—Bill Jones. He raised a ghostly
finger for silence. ‘‘I’ve studied  spiritualism’’ said Bill, ‘‘Don’t get frightened.
Shucks, your’e short of news.’’ On the
Seribe a faint light of understanding dawned.
Bill with his great love for Pine Hill had
come back to rescue him in_ his perplexity.

The curtain fell. Dumbells was over.

THE DALHOUSIE GAZETTE

ON OUR EXCHANGE SHELF.

BRUNSWICKAN.

 

The first issue of the U. N. B. Brunswickan is
rather slim with only two short prose pieces. “The
Hand of Memory,” a short tale of revenge and
forgiveness, is well done without the artificiality
frequently noticed in college short stories.

The report of the Freshette debate is very interesting. It seems that the freshettes were
divided into two sections and madé to debate the
subject “Beauty versus Brains” before their
seniors. The freshettes admitted quite a lot of
things before they were done.

 

ACADIA ATHENAEUM.

 

The graduation number of the Athenaeum is
now at hand and is excellent. One hundred ard
fifty pages crammed with prose and’ poetry,
pictures, and the accounts of the year’s work |)
every branch of activity make it one of the best
issues that we have seen. Excellent photographs and
character sketches of the graduates, with the
valedictory, class history and prophécy make it a
real graduation number and one that will be kept
and treasured by every one of the graduating
class. It is really a year book and a college
literary paper combined.

 

SHEAF.,

 

Weiner (or “hot dog”) parties are becoming a
favorite form of class affair in western universities.
The ease with which the weiner is prepared and
its succulence are making it much more popular
than corn or beans for the material foundation of
a good time,

Although ostensibly a newspaper the Saskatoon
Sheaf has a number of comic poems in their last
issue. We quote the shortest:

“THE BLUSHING BRIDE.

 

They tell us of the blushing bride
Who to the altar oes,
. Down the centre of the church
Between the friend-filled rows.
There’s Billy, whom she motored with,
And Bob with whom she swam;
‘here’s Jack, she used to golf with him;
And Steve, she called her lamb. .
There’s Ted, the football man she owned
And Don of tennis days.
There’s Herbert, yes, and blonde Eugene
Who took her to the plays.
And there is Harry, high school beau,
With whom she used to rush,
No wonder she’s the blushing bride,
Ye gods! She ought to blush! |

Shirreff Hall

An eventful week has passed and a more
than eventful one is promised. Most of the
girls went home for the week-end, and the
burning question is now—‘‘Where are
Angie’s pijckles?’’ But everyone is back
now, and as the exam list is posted, all shake
with fear.

S. H. is more than fortunate in having
Miss Gertrude Rutherford, the S. C. M.
Secretary, as a guest for a week. She is a
jolly good sport. When those who are not
active in the 8. C. A., think of Miss Rutherford and Miss Lowe, they begin to think that
there is really something worth while in it
after all. Then perhaps they will try to discover what it may be.

The telephone has been out of order for
two days,

In her thirst for knowledge 8. H. asks:
Why do the ladies in B4 and B5 delight in reclining upon sticky fly-paper? Have they a
naturally clinging disposition? In that same
locality, why is the hymn about ‘‘Salem’’ so
popular?

Why did Bert bother to buy her blotting
paper anyway?

Any kick coming, Pine Hill?

Congratulations to Miss Hope Hamilton
upon winning the poetry prize last month.

SHIRREFF HALL ENTERTAINS.

The dance given by the girls of Shirreff Hall on
Friday night was certainly an event to be remembered. : .

Being the first formal dance held in the new
residence, it created considerable excitement and
was looked forward to very eagerly both by the
hostesses themselves and the ‘favored few’ who
were to be their guests. It more than fulfilled
their expectations.

The Hall is ideal for such an affair; the loftyceilinged refectory made an admirable ballroom,
while the well appointed library, the reception
room and the entrance hall, with its cosy nooks,
were used to advantage between dances.

Mr. and Mrs. G. Fred Pearson, Mr. and Mrs. |

Murray Macneil and Miss Rutherford, National
Secretary of the S. C. Ay were present as guests
of Miss Lowe and the girls of the Hall.

THE GARISH SHAWL, /
(Continued from page 4)

slope... The mastiffs of the Civil Guard!_-- ~

The solemn intonations of Maria drowned the
barking of these fierce beasts as they coursed
through the vineyard. Presently her voice
quivered. It awoke in him a swift recolleection of his life—the inexplicable reproach of
its thousand carousals, its hopeless passion
and swaggering threats. (Note:—The Editor
must here delete the death of the five mastiffs
owing to the lack “ apene. )
The Genius of G. Minisia Shaw.

As she enters, phonographic music is heard
in another part of the house. One recognizes
the rapid, sensual strains of the Venusberg
music. It seems to absorb the young man,
for he settles down in a chair, a tranquil look
replacing the former expression on his face.
The woman is the first to speak.

**You still dislike my mantle, Talmer ?’’

_**Ah, that is real music; perhaps to you
mere doggere], but to me heavenly harmony.’’

‘Well that part is rather peppy, though
I’d hate to try fox-trotting to it,—but the
mantle ?’’

‘*Oh, yes, the shawl. Sometimes I almost
wish it were a shroud. It always seems to
accent your prudery. Elsie; I wish you’d
change your ideas. Don’t you realize that
you cannot retain your youth forever? Marriage is a duty. Even in the Book of Common Prayer, it is stated that the essential
function of marriage is the continuance of the
human race. You are no Hedda Gabler, to
shoot yourself because maternity is so unladylike.’’

Appalled by the outburst of his vehemence,
Elsie remained silent. |

The music had now reached the height of

_ the crescendo, and as Talmer finished speak
ing, the leit-motif of the Pilgrims’ Chorus
falls on their ears.

‘“Talmer, when that record finishes, put on
something more snappy. Whenever I play
your favorites, your puritanical side will

_ come to the surface, and I have to listen to

your theories of marriage. When we get

_ married—if we ever do—I hope you ‘ll give

_ the Gabler woman, whoever she is, out of the
 conversation.’’
The record had ceased to revolve. Silently
_ Talmer arose, and wandered off in the direetion of the machine.

The Dalhousie. Tigers football team made a
successful trip to Prince Edward Island last
week, winning both their games and blanking
their opponents,

The tour was a success in more ways than
one, as very friendly relations were established and firmly cemented between the players and the citizens of the Island.

Although success in the game is of importance, yet the matter of good sportsmanship is
the real element of a contest. The Abbies
and St. Dunstan’s, although defeated on the
field, showed themselves true sports and
entertained the visitors royally.

That Dalhousie’s men also lived up to
her traditiofis is plainly manifested by the
telegram of Mayor Jenkins to President MacKenzie, which reads: ‘‘Congratulations on
your wonderful football team. All are artists and perfect gentlemen as well. Our citizens will be pleased to welcome them again
at any time.

R. H. JENKINS.’’

The Tigers have nothing but the highest
praise for their reception and entertainment
in Charlottetown. An invitation was extended the Dalhousie hockey team to journey to
the Island this winter. At the request of
Mayor Jenkins a holiday was granted to the
Dal students last Saturday, and many took
the opportunity to witness the St. F. X.-Dal
game at Truro.

Dalhousie defeated St. Dunstan’s College
by a score of 14—0 in the first game on Saturday, Nov. 10th. The Tigers had the advantage in territory and outplayed the Red
and Whites who were baffied by the speed and
accuracy of the Dal players. Capt. Haslam
was the star, getting three trys. Langwith
accounted for the fourth. The ground was

fair condition considering the recent rain,

and the weather was ideal for football. W.

J. Maedonald of the Abbies refereed.

On Monday, Thanksgiving Day, Dalhousie
defeated the Abbies by 13—0 in a hard
fought game. The Tigers had a wide margin of territory in the first period, scored two
tries, converted one and foreed the Abbies to
touch for safety eight times.

The Abegweits improved in the second stanza and tackled harder but could not prevent
Jones from going over for the third try
which was converted by Haslam. Langwith
and McInnes each scored a try in the first
period. Sree nee enone

DALHOUSIE won. McCU RDY

The Dalhousie Tigers. defeated the St.

Francis Xavier Rugby Football Team by the
large score of 32-0 in their game at Truro last

Saturday and won the McCurdy Cup and
the Championship of the Maritime Provinces.

Only during the first part of the game were
the Saints dangerous.

The Dalhousie serim controlled the ball
practically at will and thus the halves were
given many opportunities to show their
form.

Play was in St. F. X. territory during the
greater part of the game, and after the Tigers
got the first try, their quickness to grasp an
opening baffled the Saints. The first period
was the better of the two and ended 8-0.

Play opened up with Sandy Macdonald
kicking off for St. F. X. and the Tigers soon
forced the pigskin up to the twenty yard line,
where Haslam almost scored by a drop~kick.
Currie cleared for the Saints, but Bates
picked up the ball, made a great run and
passed to Haslam who scored at try directly
behind the posts. He also converted - it
making the score 5—0.

Murphy gained for ‘the Xaverians and
Langwith made a good run but was forced out
near the line. As the result of the scrim
here the halves received the ball perfectly
and the leather was passed across the field to
Langwith who made the second try. Haslam
failed to convert. Score 8—0.

Flaherty carried the ball for the Saints;
Kelly MeLean returned with’ it and was
foreed out on the thirty yard line. The
whistle blew for the first half with the Tigers
pressing hard.

Haslam kicked off at the opening of the
second period, and the Dal half-line made a
quick get away; Langwith and MelInnes
played a good combination which resulted in
another try by Langwith after covering
three quarters. of ‘the. field. Haslam converted making it 13—0.

Boyle made a run for the Saints but Fraser
saved; and Clouston almost went over for a

a the leather immediately and the
eatch was fumbled by Murphy. oe

The Saints began to push matters a little
harder and Macdonald, McEachren, Flaherty
and Cameron gained the Dal twenty yard
line, from here ‘‘Dinty’’ Moore gathered in
the ball and dashed up the field fooled the
full-back and notched up another try. Score
29—0. Haslam failed to convert. Play
continued in St. F. X. territory, with the
Xaverian worn out and attempting to stem
the onrush of their opponents, The Tigers
half line were working perfectly and made
great runs every time they got the ball. Asa
result of one of these plays McOdrum went
across for the last try making a‘grand total
of 32—0.

F. W. Allen refereed very satisfactorily.

Dalhousie, forwards, McLean, Logan, Jones,
Livingstone, Baird, Sutherland, Moore, halves
Haslam, Langwith, McInnes, McOdrum; fullback, Fraser.

A GOOD EXAMPLE.

 

Methusaleh ate what he found on his plate,
And never, as people do now,
Did he note the amount of the calory
count—
He ate it because it was chow.

He was quite undisturbed when at dinner
he sat,
Destroying a roast, or a pie,
By the thought it was lacking in pauls
fat
Or a couple of vitamines shy.

He cheerfully chewed every specimen of
food,
Untroubled by worries or fears;
Lest his health should be hurt by
some fancy dessert,
And—he lived over nine hundred years.

DALHOUSIE MOOT COURT. .

The fourth case to be tried before the Moot
Court was heard last Thursday afternoon,
their ‘‘Lordships’’ chief Justice Maddin,
Mr. Justice Milner and Mr. Justice West presiding. It was an appeal from the decision
of Watchorn, J, on an originating summons
that Mr. Arthur was not entitled to Blackacre, on the following facts: Arthur conveyed
Blackacre to Black and his heirs to have and
to hold unto Black and his heirs as long as
Elmsdale remains an unincorporated village.
It is admitted that Elmsdale has become an
incorporated town and Arthur unsuccessfully
attempted to re-enter.

Owing to the difficulty of securing authority to decide such a difficult point of law as
was brought up in the case the arguments of
the opposing counsel was necessarily short.

The appellant was represented by Miss
Wambolt, K. C., who presented her argument
in a clear and concise manner. Her learned
opponents,. Miss Stewart, K. C. and Miss
MacIntyre also showed that they had given
their case careful preparation.

Their Lordships deemed it advisable to
reserve judgment.

The occasion was one of unusual interest in
that it was the first time in the history of
Dalhousie that so many of the weaker (?) sex
had taken an active part in the proceedings
of the Moot Court.
