The Canadian Club of Boston has
taken action in respect to the ‘‘Old
Home Week”’’ in Nova Scotia in 1924.
The many sons and daughters of Nova
Scotia in the New England States are
keen to have the celebration carried
through, and with that idea in view a
petition addressed to Premier EK. H.
Armstrong and the mayors of cities and
towns throughout the Maritime Provinces has been prepared. This petition,
of which we acknowledge receipt of a
copy, has embodied in it. e resolution
passed by the Canadian Club of Boston,

   

which sets forth in some detail the bene
 

fits and advantages which they believe
will accrue from the Old Home Week,
and makes a request ‘‘on behalf of the
many thousands of former ians

here to accede to the great wish
and desire to take immediate steps to

  
 

_ put this oe into execution and accomplishment.’

this exodus, but it is admitted on all
sides that if we could induce these emigrants to return to Nova Scotia, even
for a short visit, much would be
gained.

To quote the resolution again, on another point: ‘‘A great. mental stimulus
will be created, a higher estimation of
Nova Scotia and the Maritime Pro
vinces as the great summer resort, a

great playground for New England,
that its reactive effect upon the American tourist class and travelling public
will be stimulating and helpful.’’

Here is something which might well
occupy the attention of the university
students, something to which they could
give their energetic support and with
the vigor of youth, promote an activity
which would be of lasting benefit to their
native province.

 

Throughout this year, our readers
will have noticed, we have had a series
of letters from graduates in other universities from which we ean gather
something of the student life in those
centres. While it will be recognized
that the writers’ comment, for they are
generally personal letters, not articles
prepared carefully for publication, will
be influenced to a considerable extent
by the opinions and general viewpoint
of the particular scribe, yet we believe
that they are interesting and contain
information very valuable to those who
contemplate post graduate study.

Every dollar helps. Why not be the
next helper?

SUCCESSFUL “INFORMAL.”

Over Five Hundred Students Attended
Enjoyable Function of Retirmg
Council.

The sowree held in the Gymmasium on
Friday evening last under the auspices
of the Student Council was one of the
happiest social functions of the year.
From the opening ‘‘Paul Jones’’ until
the last waltz, the whole company: numbering well over five hundred, enjoyed
themselves immensely. The absolute lack
of formality was the outstanding feature
of the dance and it was readily adopted
by the students.

Norman A. ‘‘Larry’’ MacKenzie,
president of the U. S. C. weleomed the
guests in a short speech which was responded to by J. G. Fogo on behalf of
the students.

Music of a high order was provided
by the Harmonic Orchestra, a novelty
being introduced by the addition of a
second pianist who played during the
intervals, thus making the music and
opportunity to dance practically continuous.

The chaperons for. the evening were
Professor and Mrs. Nickerson, Mr. and
Mrs. G, Fred Pearson were also to be
there but unfortunately, owing to a
death in the family, could not be present.

Refreshments were served at an
early hour and the party continued until 12.30. Much of the success of the
whole affair was due to the committee
in charge which consisted of Messrs.
W. N. Jones and J. D. Fraser. As
master of ceremonies ‘‘Bill’’ was also
of great assistance and his efforts were
highly appreciated. =

DR. HERBERT GREY.

Dr. Herbert Gray has come and

of his sojourn. From the hour of Saturday noon, when five hundred students

The New Brunswick Society.
For many years past there have

been New Brunswick students at Dal
housie, most of whom did not know the
others. At last they have met together,
formed a Society and have become, as
a body ‘‘an integral part of the ye

Mr. Nicholson suggested that offcers for the Society be elected with the

Everybody then enjoyed a dance,
and the gathering broke up shortly after

very able and charming chaperone of
the evening.

Lecture by Dr. MacMechan.

‘‘Kipling’’ was the subject of a very
fine lecture delivered by Doctor MacMechan at the Chureh of England Institute, last week.

After briefly sketching the events
of the writer’s early life, Doctor MacMechan showed how Kipling had struck.
a new note in poetry, very different
from that of Tennyson, and which announced the commencement of a new
era. It was with Kipling as a_ poet
that the lecture dealt, and he showed in
a most interesting manner, the poet’s
qualities, emphasizing his adherence to
reality and the way in which he makes
“deck hands speak like deck hands and
not like: clergymen,’’ which, however,
has not been recognized as a merit by
some critics. Mes

Doctor MacMechan interspersed the
lecture with readings of Kipling’s poems
such as ‘‘Our Lady of the Snows,”’
‘‘McAndrew’s Hymn,’’ ‘The Post that
Fitted,’”’ and ‘‘Flowers.’’ This part of
the lecture was particularly delightful
due to Doctor MacMechan’s wonderful
powers of interpretation.

COLLEGE BOYS

College professors, however, who go
to the trouble to inform themselves on
what the students are doing outside of
the classroom as well as on the inside,
ean easily predict the future of most of
the boys. The boy who enters into the
life of the college will enter into the life
of the larger community when he is
graduated. The qualities which he has
displayed there will manifest themselves when he is brought into contact
with other problems. And he will continue qualifying himself for new duties
until the day of his death. There may
be exceptions, but this is the rule—

Pine Hill Post

A prominent visitor to the residence
this week was the Rev. Angus Gillis
who graduated from here last year.
Why he came or what he was doing here
nobody knows but everybody makes a
very shrewd guess, but if two people
guess differently one of theni is wrong.

The theologues have been delivering
their orations the past tew weeks.
Their subjects cover the fields of virtue
and iniquity, science and history and to
every other path where they may find
themselves familiar. Robb. who played
such a conspicious part with the Stewiacke girls’ hockey team on the way
to Sackville, went over to the college
the other day to hear one of these orations and to lend color to the proceedings in his Korean bathrobe. However
the faculty feared that he was vieing
with them in the matter of hoods, and
fearing a mistake might be made ordered him off home to return properly
attired.

Bob Scott has had two teeth extracted and as a result won’t be able to sing
for a couple of days. This would correspond to J. D. N. MeDonald’s lucid
interval, which was never known to occur.

Mr. James Arthur Forbes wishes a
correction from the last issue. He says
his residence is not the Marlborough
Woods but room 44 Pine Hill. We
apologize for the mistake.

Pine Hill will be well represented on
the Students’ Council next year, no less
than six of the elected belonging to the
residence. Bill Jones is wiping his
sword afer the desperate contest with
Johnston Chew. Bob Ross says its all
right as its all in the family.

Our friend Garth Toomes takes issue
with Dr. Gray on one point, that all are
sinners. He maintains that his little

irl on ‘‘the island’’ is a little angel

from heaven to use his own words, and

couldn’t do anything wrong. However,

The Heart Of A Shamrock.

Oh! what’s tucked away in the heart of
a Shamrock ?

A shamrock from Erin’s dear isle!

A word built of kindness, a grateful
heart’s blessing,

A thought or a tear or a smile?

Are there golden bright sunbeams that
tumble from heaven

And joy to the sober world bring?

Or silver shod raindrops that patter
down paths

Like the wee tripping footsteps of
Spring?

Is there music of birds thrilling up
through the morning

And laughter of brooks as they leap

And the slumberful voice of the sad
little breezes

That rock the blue violet to sleep?

Are there dreams hidden under the
little green petals?

Sweet, magical, Irish dreams

Of castles and princes, enchantment,
and fairies

That dance neath
beams.

Is there whisper of Erin, old Erin, dear
Krin!

The Land of the Saints and the true,

Is there gleam of her valleys and breath
of her mountains

And flash of her rivers’ clear blue?

Ah! truly I’ll tell you that this is the
secret

That sets the frail shamrock apart:

All the sweetness of earth and the rapture of heaven

Are tucked in a shamrock’s small heart.

Owing to the hockey games that
have been recently played at Truro, a
large number of the boys have found
time to visit the ‘‘Hub’’ over the weekends. In fact the passenger traffic has
been so heavy that Sir Henry Thornton
has agreed to stop the Monday morning
milk train opposite University Hall. It
is expected that a station will be erected
by spring. A prize has been offered
for a suitable name for the depot. Any
contributions should be sent addressed

they was some ‘‘awful swell guys’”’

was ably represented.

Snowshoe parties have been quite
popular on Saturday afternoons lately.
In the future, however, parties returning home from such excursions are requested not to take street cars that pass

A Few Observations of a Well-Known
Graduate of This University.

“This is exam. week. I suppose
exams. in January make the Spring
trm shorter. We only have-exams in
the subjects which end at Xmas. The
rest carry on till April. We have an
no idea how we made out yet, but the
papers generally had the usual ‘Dalhousie”’ failing, so long they looked
like the ‘‘Alumni News’’—printed on
the same kind of paper, too.

We were very amused at the 100%
attendance fracas. The ‘‘Herald’’ gave
it prominence enough. The students,
who spoke of it here, thought it was a
great joke. Personally, I was glad to
hear of the decided stand the student
body took and finally the 10% leeway
came back. It should not take much of
a mind to see the impractibility of 100%
attendance. :

Up here, all the old worries of the

‘Dal’? student body are run by student
control alone. We have a leeway of
1214,% in the attendance line, and in
moat of the laboratory work, our stay
for the afternoon simply depends on
how fast the group can work.

Credit is given for lost attendance
due to major sports. The greatest
difference is the attitude here in the
athletic question. All students coming
up for the first time have to pass a.
university medical examination. Physical training is compulsory—two
hours a week—for the first two years of
all faculties and generally you are encouraged to take part in sport. There
are good instructors in all branches of
sport. I cannot see that it interferes
with the intellectual standard very
much. The athlete generally gets thru
and the percentage of failures here is
usually less than that I was accustomed
to hear off. |

All new students, in Science anyway
are posted to an advisor. First and
second year students who do poorly in

_ test examinations are posted to tutors
and have to attend extra classes—one
or two hours a week. We never had
that at Dalhousie and I often th
that the exodus after the Christmas
examinations was due mainly on that

numbers and is perhaps a more workable body. '

In Science, at any rate, the classes
are much the same size as at ‘‘Dal.’’
The ones with the extra large enrolment are broken up and have two lectures. The laboratories are large and
well equipped. We work in groups 0!
four or five. The time in the ‘‘lab’’ is
all taken with getting data and results
and reports are worked ‘up at home.
We sure know what a ‘‘report’’ means
now. Four or five a week is no fun, In
that way more active work is done, altho the church attendance on Sunday
usually suffers. The lectures are fifty
minute periods—with a ten minute
break. .

The Junior years of all faculties
combine to get out a year book called
the ‘‘Annual.’’ It has a picture of each
member, with a short biography, besides
the; groups of societies and teams common to all the college. It gives a complete and excellent souvenir of your
stay at MeGill.

The residence situation is in a far
worse state than Dalhousie. ~The women students are well provided for but
there is no building connected with the
college capable of holding any number
of male students.

Smoking and reading rooms are
provided and no one takes your name
and number if you accidently walk up
the stairs with a burning cigarette.

The attendance here is much larger,
of course.
near the whole Dalhousie enrolment.
Still, due to the system of advisors,
tutors, ete., it loses none of the personal
touch we had at Dalhousie. |

There is no band night at the rink
here. We have three open air rinks in
the campus. One used for hockey alone.
For a small fee we have good skating
all winter.

What To Read.

Lord Riddell, the great English
newspaper proprietor, was _ recently
asked to contribute to a symposium of
books which might be of assistance in
forming the character of a young man
of twenty-one, Various other men of
high standing’ in Knglish — literature
were asked for contributions, and the
lst was a long one. No attempt will
be made to include it here. Lord Ridce l’s contribution, however, consisted
of five works: Anson on Contract, Pollock on Torts, Best on Evidence, Shakesneare’s Plays and any good arrthology
of English poetry. Few of you are
likely acquainted with the first three
works, for they are legal text-books;
but the last two are known to all, in fact
they are found in most households.

Now Lord Riddell is a man of some
consequence in Great Britain, and his
opinion is worthy of the consideration
of everyone. To begin with, he is not
a lawyer, altho he is evidently familiar
with the text-books of the law. He is
an essayist of some note, a newspaper
reporter and a newspaper proprietor.
He is the man who represented the Eng‘ish Press at the Peace Conference held
in Washington in 1919 and 1920. Undoubtedly, he is a man of the world in
the truest sense, a fact which is evidenced by his writings, which are marked by their wealth of common sense.

His choice of literature in the present instance is a very excellent one.
But perhaps this will not be apparent
to every one at the first glance. Neverthe less, such is the case. A more comprehensive selection to fit the need
could hardly be imagined, It is his aim
to extend by means of these books the
philosophy of fellowship, the philosophy
of ‘‘live and let live.’’

Turning to the books themselves,
let us take wp each one individually.

The first book, Anson, deals with the
law relating to contracts, or more plainly, bargains, for that is all that a contract amounts to. Every day we are
making bargains. Now when a man
enters into a bargain, he is entitled to
look to the future with a feeling of
security. Before he can do this he must

rights and obligations existing between
people in their everyday life, and these
are the only chapters it is necessary to
read. This is not a world of hermits,
but a place wherein we all must live and
work togehter. Difficulties are bound to
arise, and unless there is harmony little
work tan be done. It is the purpose of
the Law to bring about this harmony,
and everyone should have a general
knowledge of the means employed.

The first sixty-five pages of Best on

Evidence should also be read. ‘These
introductory pages outline generally the
way in which to judge evidence. Popular or simplified logic you might call it.
The person who is unable to draw a
reasonably correct conelusion from
what he hears other people saying, is
apt to get both himself into trouble, and
other people as well. Time and again
things are not fully explained. The
hearer is left to infer certain things,
and he who is acquainted with the principles of evidence, such as are laid down
in the law courts, has a great advantage
over the untrained. It is an advantage,
which at times may be very hard to
calculate in ordinary values.

And then, Shakespeare. Now we
are again treading on familiar ground.
Here we get an insight into human
nature in its broadest aspect. Shakespeare is limited to no narrow bounds.
His material is gathered irrespective of
place and time. Even if the present.
was substituted for the historical backgrounds, no change would be necessary
in his characters. Human nature is
always the same. Sorrow, anger and
jealousy are all portrayed. Even the
keenest sense of humor may here receive its final edge.

The last of the selection is an anthology of English poetry. No pagticular edition need be taken. All that is
es is me ‘* on should

The life of the nation is expend ta
its verse. The shadows of defeat, the
struggle against oppression and the tide
of prosperity are all alike reflected in
the mirror of national poetry. The only
way to appreciate our world is to understand the troubles and joys, the ups and
downs of other days. _

The names of a large number of

DR. HERBERT GRAY.
(Continued from page 1)

at luncheon, dinner and banquet, Dr.
Gray was ever the almost awesome and
altogether admirable ‘man that he is.
Struggling with a terrific program,
which covered every hour of his stay,
he showed not a sign of flinching, uttered not a word but of cheer and encouragement.

‘‘His word was with power’”’ and
he told boldly what he believes to be
the source of that power—that it lies
in a complete response to the challenge
of Christ.

‘Christianity embodies the one summons to men and women that is adequate to their humanity, and it offers to
the rare the one hope of solving all the
problems of civilization.

Once men and women have really accepted Christianity so conceived, it is
my faith that they will very soon offer
to the world a demonstration of its
truth beyond all challenge.’’

Large and stormy was the gathering

at the semi-annual meeting of the
D. A. A. C. on Tuesday March 8th.

The meeting was ‘called principally
for the election of new officers for the
coming year. Fabie Bates was elected
President of the D. A. A. C.

Reports were read by the various
managers of hockey, football and basketball teams. Mr. Charles Baxter, manager of the football team, reported that
his team was successful in winning the
inter-collegiate championship of the
Maritime Provinces although they were
not as successful in the city league.
The football team was brought back a
week before college opened to get into
shape and as this proved very successful he recommended that the players be
brought back at least one or two weeks
early next year. A vote of thanks was
passed to Mr. Dickie, for his valuable
assistance in coaching the team.

Charles Beazley, manager of the
Hockey team, could not report fully as
the hockey season has not yet closed.
The Tigers were third in the city league
but are strong contenders for the Intercollegiate title as they have already won
the Kastern section.

The basketball team had a very successful year.

As regards the finances, the hockey
and football teams have made approximately what they have. spent. $556 out
of this amount was spent on the bleachers at Studley.

A motion introduced by Mr. Baxter
concerning the amount of money to be
appropriated to the various teams for
equipment was passed.

The track team has not ‘yet had a
‘‘meet’’? but Mr. Clifford expects to arrange one before the year closes and
some good men have been lined up.

Don McInnes, manager of the Swimming Team was unable to be present to
report. — |

G. Bruce, who was appointed by the
executive to ascertain the price of the
insignia to be awarded the members of
the Teams, .stated, that they are very
expensive. On motion of ‘‘Dinty”’

oore it was passed that if there is not
sufficient money to go around, these
distinctive badges should be presented
year. |

A SUCCESSFUL TRIP.

Dal’s basket ball squad with Muir,

Grant, Wilson, Coster, MacOdrum as
regulars, and Miller and Harrison subs,
made a trip to Mt. A., U. N. B. and St.
John. Owing to illness, Ivan Mader
was unable to make the trip.

The first game, at Sackville, was
very fast and exceptionally clean.
Superior combination and close checking gave the Dal men a win, score 37-12.

Leaving Sackville at 2.30 a. m., the
team arrived in Fredericton about noon.

That night U. N. B. and Dal played to

a draw the final score being 28 all.

In spite of the game being somewhat
rough, the spirit of good will which
exists between the two colleges was certainly retained, and the Dal boys were
all smiles at the informal dance which
was held in their honor after the game.

Saturday morning at 9a. m, the
team once more journeyed to St. John
this time to encounter the Trojans. The
game was very fast, but the superior
weight and condition of the Trojans told
on the ‘‘Tigers’’. The close of the first
half saw the score 18-13 in favor of the
Trojans, the final gong showed the score
44-28 with Dal on the small end.

One of the outstanding features of
the trip was the welcome tendered the
Dal team by the U. N. B. Co-eds. This
quickly appreciated and Red Grant,
was ably assisted by Don Webster, led
the way. |

At St. John, Mr. Sterling, the
coach, was the hero of the hour, and at
the Saturday night dance, led the boys
to many conquests over the fair maidens
of St. John. |

Sunday was marked by the manager
going to church. The minister, recog
nizing this fact, kindly extended his ser
mon to an hour and a half. On awaken
ing, Merle said he certainly enjoyed the

Dal Girls at Wolfville.

Taking a long lead of 19 to 5 in the
first period, the Acadia girls were able
to hold down the redoubled attack of
the Dalhousie quintette in the second
period of the intercollegiate basketball
game at Wolfville on Saturday afternoon, and won by the score of 28 to 10.

Dalhousie’s combination was good,
but the very superior guarding of the
Acadia defence broke up plays before
they resulted in scores.

After the game the Acadia girls entertained their visiting guests at an informal tea which was very much enjoyed. During the earlier part of the day
the Acadia swimming pool was placed
at the disposal of the Dal girls and an
hour of good sport was enjoyed. The
Aeadia student body turned out enmasse
at the depot to bid their guests farewell.

FOOTBALL CAPTAIN ELECTED.

Montford Haslam was elected Captain of the Dalhousie football team for
next year at the annual ‘‘photo day’’,
the customary time for such an election
at Dalhousie. Readers of the Gazette
are all aware of Mont’s outstanding
athletic ability and achievements, and
will thus be able to appreciate this
well merited recognition of his sportsmanship.

Basketball

When to Dribble.

1. A dribble is -valuable when
there is no one between the player and
the basket, to get in close enough to
made the shot sure. 2. When there is
only one guard between the forward and
his goal, he should fake a pass, to a
team mate, then dribble around the
other side of the guard, thus getting in
close for a shot. 3. If playing on a
large floor a good dribbler can dribble
the ball to mid floor, to enable his team
mates to get into position for a combination play. When a dribble starts there
should always be one man behind to
cover a fumble, or to whom the dribbler
can’ pass. Dodging, turns and stops
should be practiced in connection with
the dribble.

A CONTRAST.

The Prof. of Pathology offers this
definition :

LIFE is the persistant recurrent
satisfaction and dissatisfaction of the
affinities of the proteinogenous molecules. | |

A writer in the Evening Mail declares that:

LIFE is nine-tenths vanity. In the

GENIUS DISCOVERED IN
FRESHMAN CLASS’
To Simon Hick,
Peat Corners, N. 8.

Dear Sir,—I haven’t wrote you for
the last couple weeks cause I’ve been so
dang busted busy going’ skatin, dancin,
and takin in everything, and anyway
pa, the folks must be all snowed in
after that hum dinger of a storm we

no sense writin’ if you wouldn’t get my
letter, you musta missed it, pa, you and
mum and Nan, I mean.

of them letters to you awhile ago, and
a feller picks it up and now they wants
me to give em a copy of each manuscript (that’s a good word, ain’t it,
pa,) before I made it, cause there goin to publish them in the Gazoot or
somethin. You don’t care, do you, pa?
Remember what you sez to me when I
was pullin out for the big city after
New Year’s. Rube, me boy, sez you,
you’ve got a great response, if you
don’t make the Hicks’ fame, no other
cantankerin branch of the old tree will.
Remember, pa, you gets all excited and

Frashur (he’s one of dem big guys
round here), told me I wouda been on
the debatern (can’t spell that word,
pa,) teams if I’d a wanted to try. Say,
pa, d’ye member when you ustea come
over to Hi Brown’s pond to watch yer
prodigal play in hockie. Gee, pa, yer
oughta see ’em play that game here.
The fellers got fooled this year, tho;
they thot they wuz goin to beat all the
teams, but they didn’t, they got beat
out themselves. I kinda knew they
wuznt goin to win, but I kept it under
me belt, pa.

D’ye remember, pa, when I wuz
home fer the holeydays and I wuz tellin mum and Nan and you bout all the
dances we wuz goin to have after the
festive season (gittin kinda frasical,
eh, pa. I got that outa the Prayer
Book. Show that to mum, cause I promised her I’d go to church, didn’t I?)
Well, the Senate went and commandeered that we’d have to git there permishen, and they’d all have to disband
in the middle of the night soaz we could
hit the hay before one. That Senate,
pa, gee, there kinda out a luck with the
fellers now, pa. Trouble is with em,
pa, there to gosh darn religious, and

‘there all old beavers, anyway, (you

know what beavers is, pa; remember
when I was home to Xmas how old man
Mackie got sore to me when I calls him
one).

I wuz to one dance, pa, the Dalter
Gemmer, er somethin. Anyways I got
a invite to it, but I guess someone’s tryin to pull me leg, cause I only got two
dances takin. Lee Fluck (I told you
bout him, Pa,) he only got one dance
taken. He’s that big big feller. I think
the girls all think wot he’s too big to
dance, anyways.

Gee, pa, I gotta stop now, cause a
feller gives me a ticket to go to Acker’s
tonight, and Jim Graham sez wot he’ll
go with me.
