HOME MAKERS AND "TEACHERS —

By Miss Blackwood, Principal Halifax Ladies’ College

“The University of Dalhousie has several
affiliated schools where secondary education is
given. The Halifax Ladies’ College is among
the number whieh hold this honor. On the
staff of the College there are always several
. graduates from Dalhousie. The first woman
~ graduate was the Lady Principal for sonie
years.

Each year Ladies’ College students continue their studies at the University, Here
Ace play no small part in the life of, the

. University. They take their place as speakers

aa van debates, members of the Students’ Council

A and leaders in athletics, as well as proving

i" Pit ‘themselves faithful students.

e _No doubt many of the former students and

i: pe future teachers of the Ladies’ College will be
interested in the latest venture of their old

Bhp! The Department of Household
i F Betence has been reorganized and is now

ponering to students of matriculation standard

h _ a very valuable two year's’ course.
Y ~The course, which in outline is appended,

Tw how it is possible in a city like Halifax

with the University, Technical School, Hos.

- pitals and Health Centres, to obtain in the

subjects expert instruction which it is necessary for a student of Household Seience to

Bendy .

This Department offers a course of in
K abeudtion to women students who may not
re _ desire a University training who may wish

- to study in Halifax and who want thorough
iH work and a broad outlook to fit them for their
be ~ chosen profession.

In the . Department of Household ‘Science

The eachera®
years’ Course open to girls who have com:

pleted matriculation work. They may either.

have an eleven grade certificate, N. B., N.S.,
or Associate Newfoundland. A certificate will
have to show that satisfactory work in English and Seience has also been carried on_ in
whatever class corresponds to the Grade IX
and X in the High Schools.

By utilizing the various departments of our
own College we are able to give the students
the benefit of expert work, not only in the
Household Science, but in the other classes
affiliated with the’ science. Handieraft,
Home Nursing, English are taught by very
well qualified lecturers.

In our second. year, in addition to ha.

regular advanced classes in Dietetics, Cooking, ete., arrangements have been made to
utilize the various resources of the city. We
are very fortunately situated and can draw
on a great deal in our city to help us broaden
our course. The Chemistry in the first year,
Biology and Psychology of Education in the
second yedr, will be taken by instructors
from the Nova Scotia Technical College. The
Domestic. Science. carried on in the . city
schools will bexstudied, while in Dieteties the
methods of dietitians in our hospitals, large.
institutions and health centres will be
observed, The second year course in Household Arts will be along the line of interior
decoration, and the Denman Ross System of
Design will also -be studied.

An Students a in Current

Is the college student of to-day indifferent to

questions of national “and international interest?
“Does his lack of general knowledge imply that he

wishes deliberately to exclude all matters not per
' -taining to his college course and activities—or is

he merely tinobsérvant and lazy? The trend of
thought has been indicated by the attendance at
Student Conventions and the éxperience and

knowledge that have been gained in these con
ferences have given an added ‘stimulus to the

discussion of outside events.

The MacDonald College Magazine is shite: the

The solemn etillnesd « of these monastic
forridors was rudely disturbed Monday night

' py the senior class who spent one final night

of revelry. It was a banquet, an occasion
‘unique in the annals of, Pine Hill. There
were two distinguished guests in the persons
of Prof. C. L, Bennet and Prof. G, E. Wilson.
‘The menu was in itself an inspiration, The
supper was served by the chef, Edwin Johnstone; assisted by George MacIntosh and Art
Ross. Their catering left nothing to be

| dcsired. Among the dishes were “‘Beareat’’

Soup, ‘‘Swan’’ Salad, ‘‘Pringle’’ Pie, with
ee Iee-Cream, ‘‘Robb’s’’ Rolls and

“¢ Coffin’”’ Punch.

The program comprised a toast to Class 24,
by Prof. Wilson, and H. Hamilton; to Dalaia by R. H. Norton and Prof. Bennet;
to.the Ladies, by ‘‘Beareat’’ Harrison, and to
the Residence by A. D. MacKinnon, Carl.
Coffin spoke in a reminiscent vein and told
amusing anéedotes of carlier years, There
were other speeches from various geographical areas, W. H. Swan featuring N. B., H. A.
Frame distorting N. S.,. Rod. MacIntosh

: ‘modestly attempting to present C. B.’s
“attractions, and Sam Proffit vainly endeavor
ing to depict the charms of the ‘‘island.’’

‘Sam also gave a recitation. Don’ Clouston

The Editor:

Dalhousie Gazette,

Dear Sir:

. In view of the many criticisms of the ‘‘European
Student Relief” heard about the University, and of
the “Save the Gefman Children Fund,” ‘appearing
in the public press lately, the following news item
‘should be of interest: tren

Ottawa, Mar. 24.

“The gratitude of the citizens
‘Canada’s practical help after
of September ist. 1922,
signet by half a million people, received by the
Governor General, Baron Byng. Accompanying

of ‘Tokio “for
the earthquake

it is an album of which the pages are covered with...
names and soiled with dust of the devastated streets _
‘of Tokio, where passers-by were invited by the

“league for collecting ‘signatures as a mark of
gratitude for the sympathy ‘of foreign people” to.
‘express their thanks for the gifts of food, clothing,
and building material sent them in their. need,

“We have been impressed more than ever by the
foct that all men are brothers onanent the.
world,” the letter says:

It apologises for the fact that the documents be:
ame very soiled as they passed from hand to hand,
and conveyed the hope that they “will help you
renlize our sentiments of intense thankfulness?

In transmitting the album to His Excellency,

the British charge d’affairs , explains that. the

scheme originated among the students of Tokio,
‘spontaneously and free of official influence?”
The above shows clearly the human heart is

Bd not unresponsive to acts of generosity; that all

foreigners, especially the students, are not swine,

the Green Lantern ?,—-one wonders! Anyway, the
Company were in their characteristic mood, and
not even the thought of their dissolution checked
their merriness, Here it was that the “rehearsal”
played ‘its part. in the program; songs of the
operetta and other popular favorites were lustily
sung between courses, and applauded quite as
vigorously by the performers themselves, The
chorus showed that they had not. forgotten their
training; while a few daring ones, probably

affected by the lady impersonator in “Dumbells,”

broke out into a fetching or perhaps farfetched

falsetto. ’ Sf FE RR.

» Summer re for Boys

Dalhousie’s: heniéal director will open a seven
week summer camp for boys during July and
August.

A properly conducted summer camp supplies
the natural outlet for a boy’s energies. He wants

“te play, to swin,’to paddle, to fish, to go camping,

t. grow up rugged and to be with other boys.

Camp Malagawatcht will be situated somewhete
on the shores of the Bras D’or Lakes, Cape Breton,
one of the beauty spots of Canada,

“Limited Number of Boys”

By admitting only a limited numbet of boys the
director and his assistants will be able to give constant personal attention to each boy, and to adapt
the various camp activities to individual needs.

Some boys are timid or backward and require perguasion to participate in activities desirable for

their development. Other boys are too ambitious;
they need careful supervision and advice-to avoid

recklessness and over-exertion.

- Malagawatcht will not be purely a recreational
‘camp, but jrather an institution whose instructional
side will be the greater—tending | in every way
possible to the development of character and a
robust constitution, together with the acquisit/on
of valuable physical accomplishments, nor will it
bea repository for boys where he gets merely fresh
ait and good food, Every boy who comes under
our eare will receive a training—and education if
you will—that he can get in no other.

The policy of Malagatcht will be to teach the
things that boys want to know—to keep them busy
_all the time, whether it be learning to swim, paddle,

" tp _suil or play baseball.

- There will be ayatannati c. instruction in swimm.
ie diving, canoeing, sailing, gymnastics, tumbling,
knots and splices, first aid, nature “Study, life ~

“Remnants” Win Glee Club Shield.

St.. Patrick's
programs announced, saw the triumph of the
“Remnants” in the series of Glee Club entertainments. The down town students and those out-of.
residence formed this group which carried off the
Glee Club Shield, but they won by a narrow
margin for Pine Hill, coming second in the list.
scored only one point less.

The “Rémnants’” show was lively, original and
well directed. The curtain rose on a cafe scene.
At the tobles were guests apparently enjoying’
themselves very much, when the telephone rang.
Andreas Johanson rose and sang his answer into
the phone, thus introducing the opening ~ chorus
“Mr. Gee”. At this point a figure of unquestion-.
ed nationality bursts out from a huge green sham~
rock which has been standing in the centre of the
stage; it proves to be Charlie Baxter who delights
his audience with jokes and sings ‘‘There’s a Brand
New Hero,”

Then followed two entartaining, dances, one a
genuine hula hula by “Vince” Clifford attired in
beads, grass and brown paint, the other a sprightly jazz by the two “cul ah ’d” bell hops Allan:
Thompson and Bud Smith.

A violin solo by Mr.

Losada, in Bohemian

costume, was a very popular number, and his fine

technique won the appreciation of all musicians.
Another classical treat was the piano solo which
Frank Page rendered so exquisitely.

Kelly McLean in his Irish jig proved that he
can still show ’em something in the way of stepdancing. ‘Atta boy, Kelly: The famous “Seréraders” quartette also created a stir on their
appearance, and ended their selections with their
old standby and. most well known hit, “Did’ any

Perhaps the most enjoyable number on the
program, and certainly

incense and the catved statue of King Tut, four
dancers of surprising grace, the Misses Kathleen

Madeline Mader went through the intricate

Egyptian costumes lent an eerie atmosphere to the
scene,

DEAR GERRY,—

Without imagery this space would be more
than uninteresting, and imagery must always
have a concrete foundation, and it isn’t all
in our heads. The foundation for. everything appearing in this column is—F ACT.

She said her eyes were green,
A ruthless calumny;

He swore that they were blue,

Of lovely lucent hue,

Exchanged fibs not a few.

She said her eyes were green
As any garden pea,

The moon somehow got lost
Behind a filmy cloud,
He struck a match that he might see
Twin sapphires as the summer sea.
She blew it out with girlish glee:
The moon no longer being lost
Right slily smiled aloud,

So did Shirreff Hall.

Miss Shannon (glancing around) ‘‘Ssh—
No! have you?”’

 

 

FROM THE
DEAN’S CORRESPONDENCE

Young woman, writing to dean of medical
school, enclosing photographs of young
man, asks :

‘Ts this young man a student in your
institution? I am anxious to find him. Also
please let me know if you think it is right for
a young man _ to make love to a girl as a
medical experiment.’’

 

Who was the Dal Law student who signed ?

a telegram ‘‘C-q-h-n of Weymouth’’? And
has he a title other than ‘‘Davy’’?

DELTA GAMMA.

At Shirreff Hall on Saturday March 22, the
Delta Gamma Society held its final meeting for
the term. In the course of the business, officers
for the following year were elected, Miss Anna
Grant of Class ’25 Vice-President and Miss Elinor
Barnstead Sec’y-Treas. The former Secretary
Miss Harriet Elliot automatically becomes President.

The junior Crique of the Senior Class
was of course the feature of the evening; it took

the form of class day exercises at graduation in

an old fashioned boarding school, and was exceedingly well gotten up. The Juniors marched
in, some in their back-to-childhood frocks, and
others, their school mistresses, following in rigid
high necked gowns of the past century. After a
short address by the clergyman otherwise Frances

Milner, the head mistress who is also Vice-Pres.

of Class ’25 read the criticisms which were presented by the Sec’y. Ruth Fulton. They were
diplomas drawn up, signed and sealed in truly
legal fasion. |

“This is to certify that...... having passed all
the requirements of Antiqua Schola Bonorum
etc. is awarded the following certificate of charactef. is... and is accordingly admitted to Societas

The inypressions were frank and
on the whole showed thought and fairness on the
part of the Juniors.

Special prizes were presented to a few of the
outstanding figures, Amy McKean for writing,
Gertrude Mills for deportment, Clara Murray for
recitation, Edith Black for spelling and Katharine
Buttenshaw arithmetic.

With this part of the program over, refreshments
were provided by the hostesses Mrs. MacRae and
