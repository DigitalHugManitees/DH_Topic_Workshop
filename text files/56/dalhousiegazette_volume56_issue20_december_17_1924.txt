Shirreff Hall

 

The Change in Shirreff Hall

 

What a difference in the atmosphere of
the halls and corridors now: Faces which a
few weeks ago were beaming and smiling
have grown solemn, and in many cases
furrowed by thought and care; bright eyes
are dull and heavy; appetites are waning;
laughter has ceased; and feeds—we never
hear of them. Those who were wont to pause
after dinner to, ‘‘trip the light fantastic toe’’
now slip quietly up stairs laden with Britannica Encyclopedia and many who before emerged from their rooms in evening dress, on
their way to a dance, now we meet on the
eorridor, in bath-robe and slippers. Bearing,
burdens of books, they are on their way toa
fellow-worker’s room to digest the contents by
the slow process of study.

Quietness prevails for the most part especially through the evenings. Sometimes in
passing, one hears serious tones issuing from
a room, and a moments listening tells that
the occupants are deep in the study of the
Electrolitic Theory, Accusative of Specification, Dreams,—in fact any question under the
Sometimes the voices raise higher and
an argument ensues—whether to use ‘‘il’’
‘or’ “‘ee’’, but not even under such stirring
circumstances do the diseusions reach the
point they did a few weeks ago, when in those
same rooms, the same people argued over the
Ghondi Movement in India, or whether the
“*Med.’’ was a better dance than the Preanie
Soph.

The cause for this depression of youthful
spirits, this solemn atmosphere?—EXAMS!
—They are with us and the goal of a college
course, though blurred and forgotten at the
first of the term, now stands in block letters—
a Degree. And exams are the door by which
we enter this ‘lettered’ field of Society.
F. R
N. B.—To show how desperate the situation has become we quote the case of Francis
Milner, who has been sitting up late for 3
nights in succession, diligently reading a

book entitled—‘‘ How to Study !’’

 
 
  
 
 
 
 

THE DALHOUSIE GAZETTE

Football Review

The 1924 Football season ended without
any team in the Maritimes being in a position
to claim the championship.

It is conceded, especially in Halifax, that
the Wanderers had the best team in these
Provineces—their win over Dalhousie showed
that; yet they did not rub shoulders with
some speedy outside teams, They defeated
U. N. B. but were rather fortunate to win
and it is said that if the visitors had been
fresh and had not previously given Mt. A. a
hard mateh on the same tour, the result
would have been different.

The Wanderers did not meet the Caledonia
team which was an aggressive, husky, fast
aggregation and which would not allow a
game to be easily taken. This team clearly
showed its superiority over the Mt. A. squad
in Glace Bay on Thanksgiving Day and were
keen to meet the Wanderers.

The ending of the Intercollegiate League
series was unsatisfactory. Dal dropped out
of the Bastern section and left St. F. X.,
Tech, and Kings in the fight. St. F. X. won
the honors, although Kings gave them a good
run for their money. But there was. no
play-off with a team from the Western
Section. The championship for that section
was undecided since there was a three-cornered tie and Mt. A. would not agree to concede.
the victory on points.

Lack of decision as to what team in the
provinces may properly claim the championship title is unsatisfactory to everyhody.
True, it is difficult to evolve any scheme of
play-off whereby the question could be
ettled each season, but ti would be a good

 

thing for the game in the Maritimes if the

football chiefs would set their mind to the
task.

 

Medical Notes

The pre-Xmas term ‘tan ha passed smoothly
and happily: One recent. event has cast a
shadow upon us all, however, for the news

that that prince of . goodfellows, Lauchie

MacPherson, had been taken ill and gone to
the Sanatorium at Kentville, comes as a shock
to his many friends. We miss Lauchie around
college and hope that he will be back with us
soon, fully, recovered.

A meeting of the Medical Society was held
recently at which a grant made from our
funds (we really have some since the Medical
Dance) for uniforms for our basket ball
players.

Congratulations to our Med football men

on winning the Interfaculty League: Even

 

 

Pine Hill Post

The cross-word puzzle, which for the past
three weeks, held a place of undisputed
supremacy in the realm of indoor sports
and pastimes, is now rapidly losing favour:
Its popularity has been eclipsed by two games
recently introduced into the Residence—
Billiards and Ping Pong: At all hours of the
day and far into the night the steady click,
click of the billiard balls and slightly louder
staccato sounds from the Ping Pong table,
give evidence that the boys are indulging in
these mild forms of recreation. Reservations
for these tables have been booked up for days
ahead.

Symptoms of the fever are manifesting
themselves in persons hitherto considered
immune. At almost any time of the day,
Sutherland McLeod and J. D. N. may be
found hanging around the table, each with a
fascinated ,eager gaze and a mind utterly forgetful of approaching examinations:

At four A. M. when Russ. Woodside and
Gilmore’get up to go through their daily
exercise, (much and more Greek), they often
find Bearcat and Bingo, or some other*lean
and sleepless night bird, playing with the
ivory balls.

Dunphy has been making eager and extend:
ed inquiries in order to discover the real name
and character of Jehi Remm. So far, we
understand that his investigation has been
without results. t is difficult to determine
from the anxious expression in his eyes
whether he wants to send a Christmas card to
Jehi or to assassinate her
Pope Blanchard’s moustache hasn’t been
doing at all well lately, and Bill Byers, our
agricultural expert, thinks that some kind of
a blight has struck it. Another theory advanced is that since the examinations are 60
near, the Pope hasn’t been able to concentrate his mind on growing it as much as he
formerly did.

We enjoyed having the girls out here to a
Sunday night ‘‘Sing song’’. Afterwards, the

‘romantic spell of the earlier part of the even
ing still remaining, the boys gathered in the
room, sat around in the light of the slowly
dying fire, and sang hymns and songs until
long after midnight. |

There was a deep feeling of sympathy

throughout the Residence when the sad news

was received that Dave McLean's father had
passed away; and it was with a sense of shock

Boarding-House Geometry

 

Definitions and Axioms

All boarding-houses are the same boardinghouse.

Boarders in the same boarding-house and
on the same flat are equal to one another.

A single room is that which has no parts
and no magnitude
The landlady of a boarding-house is a parallelogram—that is, an oblong, angular
figure, which eannot be described but which
is equal to anything.

A wrangle is the disclination of two boarders to each other that meet together but are
not in the same line.

All the other rooms being taken, a single
room is said to be a double room.
