With cheers and a rowdy show of

adopted resolutions calling for action
in the near future by the Student’s
Society for the purpose of “dissocia=
ating ourselves from the Canadian

the C. S. A. from McGill “insofar as
it is within the constitutional power

"THE EDIT OR’S MATL

—All these letters are entirely unsolicited.
Any light that can be shed not only on the C.S.A. controversy

but on other problems of interest to Dalhousie will be welcomed.

In spite of childish and unwarranted accusations to the contrary, both sides of all questions will be presented.

THE C.S. A. AFTERMATH

Sackville, N. B., Feb. 4, 1940.
The Editor, Dalhousie Gazette,
Halifax, N. S.
Dear Mr. Editor:
I wonder if you would be good

jenough to allow me to reply through

your columns to the letter signed by
“Quintus Quiz’ in your issue of
February 2, 1940. A letter signed
under a fictitious name should carry
no weight in any event. However,
feeling, as I do, that the letter was
written with only a deliberate attempt to deceive people with regard
to the situation at Mount Allison,
I feel obliged to reply.

Winnipeg, January 28, 1940.
Grant H. Lathe, M.D.
National Secretary
Canadian Student Assembly.
Dear Dr. Lathe:

In your letter of January 22, you
ask me to make a statement with
respect to the St. Anne de Bellevue
Conference, evaluating it and suggesting its strength and weakness.
I am very glad to give you the following statement:

The Conference undoubtedly suffered from lack of organization:

_the processes by which the round

tables debated, passed resolutions

In the first place, the charge that| and sent them to the general ses
Mount Allison had decided to withdraw from the C.S.A. even before
the delegates went to the conference is a deliberate lie. As a matter of fact Mount Allison students
were more in favour of withdrawing from the N.F.C.U.S. than the
C.S.A. before the conferences were
held.

The charge that the faculty of
the University consider the whole
matter as rather childish is a very
much exaggerated statement. I have
interviewed several members of the
faculty on the question and all feel
that we have done the only sane
thing. With regard to Dr. Tucker’s
letter to the Telegraph-Journal, I
am not aware that such a letter was
written. At any rate the Dean of
Arts has not submitted any material for publication in the Argosy
on the matter, nor has he made his
views known to the students directly.

It might be interesting for Dalhousie students to know that Fred
Barton, President of the Students’
Council, did not see Dean Krug
when he was at Mount Allison. He
interviewed the student delegates
and other responsible students on
the campus.

Might I suggest, Mr. Editor, that
the next time a letter appears in
your publication purporting to express opinion on another campus
that you ascertain the facts of the
ease before publishing. The letter
appearing last week would seem to
me to be one written by and irresponsible party making a deliberate

attempt to misrepresent the entire |

situation at Mount Allison.
Yours truly,
W. B. SAWDON,
Editor-in-Chief, The Argosy Weekly.

To the Editor:

Dear Sir,—I am writing this to
draw to your attention and that of
the student body to a situation that
has, perhaps, escaped your notice,
and, as it appears, been purposely
neglected by those selected to attend to it. The graduating class of
1937, of which I was a member, presented, on graduation, to the University a trophy cabinet. Perhaps
“presented” is the wrong word to
use, for I wonder how many of
Class ’48 are aware that such a donation was even intended, let alone
carried out.

The committee in charge had access to the necessary funds practically immediately on graduation in
1937. More than two years have
passed and té my knowledge no
definite action (other than the disagreeable one of collecting the
money in a lump sum from the
Bursar’s Office) has been taken by
them to indicate even the remotest
intention of ever carrying out the
wishes of the class. In the meantime no indication has been offered
the graduates as to the reason for
this delay.

Consequently, I consider it a duty
of the Gazette to make known these
facts, and of the Students’ Council
to look into the matter and see
that such funds left by a graduating class to their Alma Mater are
not misappropriated. As I understand this is not the first time such
a situation has arisen. I trust that,
in this case, lightning will not
be allowed to strike twice in the,
same place.

Sincerely,
S. E. STEWART,
; Class "37.

sions, their reception and debate in
the general sessions, should have
been more carefully worked out. I
am inclined to think that the methods of the annual meetings of the
Canadian Institute of Internationa!
Affairs would make good models for
what is virtually a Canadian student pariiament. Have several round
tables, with a pretty closely worked
out program, let them debate, but
do not bother about findings or
resolutions.

The world will not be changed by
the findings of a student body: the
important thing is frank and free
discussion of national issues. Conclusions will come later: those that
emerge in the minds of individuals
as they go on with their studies are
the important ones. There would
be no objection to a general session
or two, but they should be brief and
reserved for set speeches, not for
endiess debate on the floor.

In the above I do not refer to
business sessions or to sessions havying specific student aims in mind:
these are obviously of another picture.

In respect to’ the Conference in
general: despite its shortcomings of
organization (I do not refer to the
endless debate over amalgamation
with the N.F.C.U.S., in which I was
not much interested), I believe it
was a most successful body. What
impressed itself on me most was
the fine relationship between English and French students: when
English students speak in French
and French students in English in
discussion of their common Canadian
affairs, history is being made. I sincerely believe that your conference
did make history: it was perhaps
unparallelel in ‘Canadian annals. No
better guarantee for our common
Canadian future could be given than
the spirit which characterized your
Conference as respects French and
English: it far transcended in importance any particular issue that
was discussed. I hope there will be
more of them.

In respect to the charges made
by Dean Krug: I happened to travel
into Montreal with him on the day

he left, but he said nothing of his],

troubles to me: we had some indifferent conversation only, so that
what I add has no reference to him
personally:

It was evident that some delegations were not as well equipped in
training and experience as others.
Many things have happened in Canada of late years and much more
serious thought has been given to
the difficulties of our Canadian position. In particular there has been
a rapid increase in the depth of
Canadian national feeling. It was
quite evident that most of the students attending the Conference were
deeply sincere in the degree of their
Canadianism: to them, devotion to
their common country (I speak to
both French and English) exceeded
any other political loyalty. I must
confess I could not find that sentiment reprehensible. After all it was
enjoined on us by the present Governor-General, who has told us that
a Canadian’s first loyalties are to
Canada.

But there

were some who had
obviously

not encountered very
much of this new way of thought:
Dean Krug is apparently among
them. Their sentiments were frankly still colonial: they had not discovered that Canada is a nation and

Amidst the hubbub of cursing

arose from the ruins, shook off two

Mary ’s Squad Edges
Out Dal Tigers, 3-1.

“Y” Defeated In Thrilling

Hoop Clash at Dal Gym

Weakened by the loss, through illness, of Bill Thomas and
Roary Black the black and gold team of Dalhousie went down

to defeat at the hands of the St. Mary’s College pucksters,

Wednesday night at the Arena. The game failed to produce
any outstanding hockey, with both teams showing poor combination efforts. Dalhousie’s lone marker was scored by John
Churchill-Smith, with Bob Blois getting an assist on the play.
Hardest worker for the Bengals was Alan Fetterly who patrolled the right lane for the Dal first line.

In the opening period St. Mary’s
had a slight edge in the play. Both
goalies were tested with long shots
as the period opened. Vinnie Vaughan got St. Mary’s first goal at about
the eight minute mark as he batted
a rebound past Munro as a result
of a gang play by the Santamarians.

Two and a half minutes before
the period ended Webster MacDonald was penalized, but the’ Saints
failed to make their advantage pay
dividends and the period ended
without further scoring.

It was in the second stanza that
the Tigers made their best showing
of the game. A penalty to Vaughan
at the start of the period gave Dal |
the edge in man-power, but they}
just failed to capitalize on their|
chances.

Both defenses were strong in this
period with Mitchell and MacDonald
standing at St. Mary’s blueline and
keeping the puck in there. The
Tigers had a nice edge in play, but
their work went haywire , around
their opponents’ cage. Time after
time they raided effectively, but the
tying goal was elusive and the score
at the bell was still 1-0 for St.
Mary’s.

Down one goal Dal opened strong
in the third period. A penalty to
St. Mary’s saw them come close, but
the rival goal-tender smothered the
puek at every threat of danger. At
the five minute mark Flemming got
St. Mary’s second goal on a pass
from Vaughan. Dalhousie again
dominated the play for the next
eight minutes, but at the thirteen
minute mark Flemming came in
fast to take West’s pass and made
no mistake as he sank his second
marker of the period.

Seemingly jinxed, the Dal boys
tried harder, but a penalty to MacDonald dimmed their hopes. Shortly afterwards John Churchill-Smith
took Blois’ pass out from a face-off
in front of St. Mary’s nets and rapped in Dalhousie’s only goal to save
his team from a shut-out. The final
score was 3-1 for St. Mary’s.

It is to be hoped that the sick
men will be in action for the next
game and thus give the Tigers the
needed strength.

DAL TIGERS DOWN Y 39-33

Dalhousie: Tigers and Dal Grads
sprang upsets in the city senior
basketball league, when they won
victories oyer the.“Y” and the Navy
respectively. The Tigers took a close |
89-33 decision from the association
quintet, while the Grads downed the
favored Navy team by a score of
24-19. |

After the Y had opened out 2
short lead at the beginning of the
game, Dal settled down and played
steady ball, overcoming the Y lead
and opening out a lead of their own. |
Shortly after the game tee
Goudey and McKenzie gave the Y
a lead which they held until as
The gold and|
black squad began to click and with |
| Wilson and Seaman doing most of|
the scoring, knotted the score at 12all. Further baskets by Smith and
Seaman gave Dal a 19-15 lead at
half time.

The second half saw Dal really
open out, as they quickly ran up a
34-17 lead. With Wilson, Smith, and
Seaman playing firehouse ball ,the
Tigers were good in around the
basket, and seldom threw the ball
away when on the offensive. Half
way through the period, the Y began to cut down the lead mostly on
long shot by Goudey and Archibald
and at one time trailed by only 5
points. A basket by Hart just before
the end of the game gave Dal a 7
point lead while the best the Y could
do was a foul shot by Bob Goudey.

Goudey and Archibald lead the Y
with 15 egd 9 points respectively,
while Seaman and Wilson had 12
apiece for the Tigers.

CUBS, 59 — KING’S, 25

Continuing their winning streak in |
the City Intermediate League, Dal- |
housie Cubs handed King’s a 58-25
defeat at the Dal gym last evening. |
The Cubs were superior in all departments of the game and the issue
was never in doubt.

With Bundy leading the attack the
Cubs really opened out from the
start, and King’s could do nothing
about it, as their long shots repeatedly failed to even come near the |
basket. At half time the Cubs had |
a 31-10 lead.

The second period was much like
the first, as the Dal squad again

MacKenzie Stars As
Frosh Gain Revenge
Over Arts & Science

Handing Arts and Science a 12-2
defeat, Freshmen established themselves as favorites to win the Dalhousie Interfaculty Hockey League,
when they showed scoring punch and
accuracy around the cage in a game
played last Tuesday at the Forum.
The Frosh scored shortly after the
opening whistle on a pretty goal by
Patterson and were never headed.

Doig made it 2-0 for the Frosh
early in the first period when he
rounded the Arts and Science defence
and beat Reilly from close in. The
period ended 2-0 for the Frosh.

In the third period, the Freshmen
rapped 7 more past Reilly and held
Arts scoreless. Smith scored two
from close in, MacKenzie counted another pair from shots in front of the
cage, and Ferguson, Patterson and
MacNeil added one each.

Bain Munro refereed.

‘Engineers Pay-Offs
'To Commerce, 36-28

Two games were played in the Dal
interfaculty basketball loop yester-|
‘day. In the first game, Commerce |
defeated Engineers 36-28, and in the |
second Arts and Science handed
Freshmen a 40-23 beating.

The Arts and Sciience forwards
began to run in points from the
outset and continued to force the
pace for the rest of the game.|
Fraser and Grant led the Artsmen
with 14 and 8 points while MacKenzie was high man for the Frosh
with 9.

Led by lanky Dave Doig, who
complied something of a record by
chalking up 30 points for himself,
Commerce took a close game from
the Engineers. Commerce opened
the scoring and by virtue of nice
ball handling and nice work in
around the basket had an 18-12 lead
at the end of the first half.

The second half was pretty even,
as the Engineers and Commerce
matched basket for basket. The Engineers played a zone defence, *but
Commerce had little. difficulty in
riddling it, as they fed the ball to
Doig, who repeatedly tossed in easy
lay-up shots.

Doig led all scorers with a total
of 30 points, while James and MacAlden led the Engineers with 12 and
8 points respectively.

Co-Eds Battle As

Dal Loses to Acadia |

Last Saturday the Dal girls played their first intercollegiate basketball game, at Acadia. As you probably know, Dal took a real beating
at the hands of the Acadians, the
score being 44-10. Although Acadia
has a fast, well trained team this
year. Dal also has lots of material
and it seems to us that the imme
game before. Another noticeable
fault of the whole game was fouling, an Acadian and two Dal girls
being put off the floor,

Although this doesn’t seem to
speak very well for the Dal co-eds.
We know that there isn’t one thing
that can’t be remedied by hard
work on the part of the team and
the coach, and we expect the next
games to be much better.

The Saturday line-up was as follows:—

Acadia—G. Ward 6, A. Harlow 5,

B. Ferguson 22, M. Bradley 7, J.
Wilson 2, E. DeWitt 2, P. Hendry,
J. CreaK, M. Hart, M. Thomas, B.
MacAskill.

Dalhousie — D. Clarke, J. Black| wood 4, B. Schwartz 4, M. MacKeigan 2, M. Johnson, K. Hicks, R.

Harrison, M. Manning.

Referee, Bev. Piers.

This Saturday night Dal is playling U.N.B. at the Dal gym. The
New Brunswickers were reported to
be good and we expect a fast game.
