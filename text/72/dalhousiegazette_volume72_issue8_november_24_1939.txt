Varsity Students
Fear Tyranny

 

TORONTO, Ont. — University of
Toronto students are up in arms
about the suspension of Toronto
municipal elections. The consensus
of student opinion is that the elections should take place under any
circumstances, although there are
those who think that a time of national emergency is no time for the
fuss and bother of municipal elections, and that those who are experienced in civic duties should be
allowed to carry on for the duration
of the war. The majority thinks,
however, that affairs should be conducted in the normal way if only to
give the appearance of order in a
major city in a country at war, and
that if the people of Toronto submit
to this sort of compulsion, it may
lead to that sort of eae we are

| Youth Congress

States Stand

 

Canadian young people are anxious “to play a‘responsible role in
the present (war) situation” and are
eager to be informed of ways and!
means by which Canadian youth organizations may be of practical
service to the country,” reports the
National Committee of the Canadian
Youth Congress.

The Committee met in Montreal
recently and representatives of many
diverse youth organizations, both
French and English, discussed at
considerable length the opinions of
young people across Canada on the
war situation. Reports were received from Local Youth Councils
in Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton,
Saskatoon, Winnipeg, Toronto and
Montreal and these formed the basis
of the national statement.

The report supports the policy of
the government opposing conscription of man-power on the grounds
that at this time “it would be
prejudicial to the unity of the
nation.” It urges the government
to maintain freedom of speech, the
press, radio and assembly, except
where military secrets are concerned.
“In waging a war against tyranny
on behalf of democracy, we do not
wish to lose our own democracy,” the
statement reads.

Complete unanimity was obtained
on every clause in the report with
one exception. The delegate from
the Montreal Y. M. H. A. refrained
from voting on the conscription
clause.

The National Committee, as a
practical plan of activity designed
towards the “strengthening of national unity”, decided to launch a
Citizenship Campaign on a national
scale.

In First Debate

On Wednesday evening, November
22nd, in the Euhretorian Hall of the
Men’s Residence at Mount Allison
University, Dalhousie coeds met Mt.
A. girls in the first scheduled Intercollegiate Debate. The subject was:
“Resolved that the English Tutorial
Method of University Education is
preferable to the American class lecture system.”

Mount Allison supported the af
 

firmative of the resolution, Dalhousie |’

the negative.

Both teams put forth excellent
arguments which showed that a
great deal of time had been spent in
preparation. Mt. A., after long
deliberation of the judges, was
awarded a 2-1 decision. The outstanding speech of the evening was
the rebuttal of Jo Anne Innis. |

The Dalhousie, team was much
praised for their delivery and for the
abundance of material which they
used in their arguments. The Mt. A.
team, however, showed a more
logical arrangement of argument.

In spite of the compliments paid
out by many of the audience, one
lady in the front row went sound
asleep.

One of the points brought up by
the negative—that the class lecture
system gave a better opportunity of
learning to know men — was quite
apt since the Mt. A. girls, who study
under this system, chose to hold
their debate in the men’s residence.

Stephen Leacock’s humor, as quoted by the negative, was evidently
too subtle for the audience because
even the picture of a “well-smoked
man” turned ou by the Oxford tutor
aroused only a faint snigger. The
biggest laugh was heard when a Mt.
A. speaker said that the three vocation periods at Oxford added up to
sixteen months.

Thursday morning the girls toured

especially the art gallery.

McGILL DAILY

OPPOSES

MONTREAL EDITORS

A heated controversy has been
raging this week between the McGill
Daily and the Montreal Gazette and
Montreal Star. To quote the McGill

Daily:

In a speech to the Montreal Rotary
Club last Tuesday, in “Poland”, Professor Adair, a member of the Department of History, condemned the
guarantee given to Poland by the
British Prime Minister last summer
as a “desperate attempt on his part
to save his face and to save the
prestige of his foreign policy and
that of the Conservative party.” He
went on to say that various statesmen of Britain had warned Mr.
Chamberlain that Poland’s integrity
could be assured only if he overcame
his “dislike of an allegiance with
Russia. This warning Mr. Chamberlain was stupid enough to ignore,
and the inevitable happened: Russia
made her own arrangements with
Germany and Poland fell.”

 

MEETING THURSDAY NOON
ARTS & SCIENCE SOCIETY

Attacks that can be described
only as “vicious” were made next
day by the two city newspapers and
subsequently the Law Undergraduate
Society, as the result of a special
meeting, sent a letter to the Gazette
and Star defending the professor’s
right to speak as he did, urging that
“Loyalty ought not to be blind,”
and deploring a tendency that seems
about to destry the very foundation
of democracy in this country.
“Surely,” the letter continues “ta man
whose knowledge of the historical
method must be regarded as adequate should be allowed to draw his
own conclusions from contemporary
events.”

After some delay and with obvious
reluctance, the newspapers printed
the letter with a rider stating that
the opinion is one of a “pitiful
minority.”

The latest step has been taken by
the students of McGill Daily, which
demands a meeting of the student
body for the endorsation of the
letter and the refutation of the
charge laid by the city newspapers.

Study Group on the
Student in Present Crisis

At a meeting sponsored by the
S.C.M. on Friday night, a group of
fourteen students, under the leadership of Prof. Wilson, came together
to discuss problems relating to the
student in the present crisis. The
group discussed how they could best
tackle such a big subject with their
present limited knowledge. It was
decided that three students should be
appointed at each meeting to do a
certain amount of research on the
topic to be studied at the next
meeting. It was urged that every
member of the group should also do
some reading. “Propaganda” was
the subject chosen for Friday, Nov.
24. All those interested be at the

Meeting of Class ’

Last Tuesday the class of ’41 held
its first meeting of the year and
elected a new slate of officers which
is as follows:

President—Forbes Mountain

Vice-President—Rose Goodman

Secretary—Carley Sullivan

Treasurer—Charles Doyle
Class finances were discussed and it
was found that the class had $120.93
to their account. With the promise
that a meeting would be called after
Christmas to discuss the Bennett

Prom, the meeting adjourned,

&
With the Council

The Council of the Students met
again on Sunday in the Men’s Common Room of the Arts Building, with
Shirreff Hall’s two delegates making
as usual a fashionably late entrance.
The first business to come up was
the appointment of a Bulletin Board
editor. Applications were received
from Shirley Kirkpatrick and Doug
McKean; Miss Kirkpatrick was appointed.

Ralph Plumer, D.A.A.C. president,
brought in a hockey budget of
$593.60, which was passed by the
Council. Mr. Plumer then reminded
Mr. Macdougall, Council representative on the Band Committee, that
two of the sweaters loaned by the
D.A.A.C. to the Band for the Caledonia game had not been returned.
This gave rise to the age-old discussion of “Where do team sweaters
go?” (which is about as answerable
as that other question “Where do the

 

flies go in the winter-time?” Nobody seems to know.)
Doug McKean was appointed

Chairman of the Student Gym Committee, to replace Gordon Kinley,
The next business was the granting
of money to defray the expenses of
the Freshman Party at Shirreff Hall.

President Barton then read a request from the Red Cross that a
campaign be made at Dalhousie:
the organization of the drive is to be
left to the Executive of the Council.
Mr. (or Dr.?) Barton then gave an
unitemized account of the expenses
incidental to the pep campaign before the Caledonia. It seems a
shame that college spirit is so expensive.

George Murphy, editor of the
Year Book, then spoke of a desirable
change in the time of the announcement of the Malcolm Honour Award
which would be advantageous both
to the fortunate student and to the
Year Book. After explaining just
what the Malcolm Honour Award
was, Mr. Murphy outlined his plan

for the announcement, which was

“mn a Dreamer

On the eleventh of November I awoke at an unusually early hour. As I gazed out of my window, I
noticed that dark clouds were floating across the sky
—how dismal and dreary a foreboding! ‘What shall
I do today?” thought I. Oh, it’s Remembrance Day!
Twenty-one years ago a treaty was signed which, I
have been told, had secured for us and all mankind a
sure peace; there was to be no more war. Never, no,
never!

At 10.30 I was worming my way through the vast).

crowds that had assembled along Spring Garden Road.
Just then the troops came marching by. ‘What fine
young men!” one girl exclaimed. “It’s too bad they
have to go to war,” retorted another. ‘Mother, there
is Harry; does he not look wonderful?” cried a young
eight-year old. The mother gazed with a blank look,
her eyes stared at the dark clouds above, tears rolled
down her cheeks.

Silent and observant, I walked along at what pace
was allowed me by the thronging crowds until I finally
arrived at the “Parade”. I quickly gained a point of
vantage so as to be able to follow the entire proceedings intelligently. The various troops marched in and
took up their respective positions. ‘Then, as though
from nowhere, the “Fathers of the City” perched themselves on the “Holy of Holies”’.

As I was gazing steadily at this magnificent spec
tacle—what else was it?—a faint voice caused me to) G,, you wonder at the legend of the

look to my right. A little boy, with dirty face, un
kempt appearance, and tattered rags, was holding up
his hand to an old woman. “Madam, spare me a
nickel; I am hungry.” “Did you have no breakfast,
my little man?” “No, madam, my fathers out of a
job, and my mother is sick.”

This conversation attracted the attention of a number of people, each of whom looked at the others with
an eye of bewilderment. Suddenly a shrill voice piped
up, ‘What an inconsistent world we live in! We can
afford to spend hundreds of dollars on bombs, and yet
we cannot care for our poor children; we pay respect
to those who died in the last war, and yet we are sending others to be killed; we pray for peace, and yet we
wage war!”

While this Soloman was still speaking, the military
band struck up the National.Anthem. We stood erect
with heads bared—a sign of honour and loyalty to the
British Crown. The grand parade was over; I returned -home, thinking deeply.

I was worried; I wanted to know whether this was
a just war—a “Christian Crusade”, as we have been

Mr. Pax: “I disagree with war because war is

Jesus
said, ‘Thou shalt not kill’.”

Mr. Bellum: “Well, suppose some one should attack
your home, your family, your mother; would you not
resist? Won’t you, even if you had to kill the culprit,
save the honour and integrity of your family? Would
you allow your home to be defiled?”

Mr. Pax: “No, I would not lift my hand against
another. I will love my wicked neighbour as myself.
But how is defending my home connected with this
war? Are you trying to suggest that we are fighting
to defend our homes, our rights, our liberties? If so,
listen; _

(a) “We are safe over here; we don’t have to
for our honor, we just sit back in comfort
for the United States will protect us.

(b) Do we really enjoy Liberty? We cannot do
as we want to. We have no freedom.”

Mr. Bellum: “So you would not fight for your own
protection, but you would have someone else do it for
you. What a Public Parasite!

“Further, you say we have no Freedom. The very
fact that you have not been executed for High
Treason is enough proof that we really enjoy Freedom.
I suppose you are looking forward to great freedom
in a Concentration Camp under Hitlerism?”

Mr. Pax: “I still do not approve of this war for war
is contrary to the highest ideals of Life; it implies
murder, disregard for Truth, Charity, Justice.”

Mr. Bellum: “That’s what Aristotle calls “‘Theological Idealism.” You are living in a world of Theoretical
Fantacies, in a realm_of Prolific Verbal Creations of
Uncontrolled and Fantastic Imagination. Be practical.
You fool, what will happen to Christianity when you
are thrown in a Concentration Camp? You will die—
but that does not matter so much—what is important
is that Christianity will suffer.

“As I saw that this battle of wits and words was
likely to develop into a bloody fray, I broke my wonted
silence and said to them, “There is nothing you can do
about it; why not talk about the weather?” I quietly
took my exit, more worried than when I entered. The
more I thought about the subject, the more was I confused. I am still thinking. If some kind person would
be willing to give me some advice and guidance his
ideas would be deeply appreciated—and what is very
rare—respected.”

 

with it lose all point if there is not a followthrough when the delegates return at the be
ginning of the new year. From theenthusiastic

and intensely practical manner which the local
assembly is adopting towards the problems not
only of this campus but Canadian problems as
a whole, it is safe to predict more lasting and
valuable results to emerge from the coming
session at MacDonald College than has been
the case in former years.

CHAPTER VI

Moose unto Moose
or
Haven't you got ere better
to do.

At that time of day, late afternoon, the gym is an extremely eerie
place. Bats flit to and fro, Ghouls
gibber from the windows and frosh
twitter innocently from the rafters.
Du Venom and Fizzleque were in one
corner being taken to the cleaners
in a quiet game of African golf by
the Dartmouth Bund. Blimp McTwitchie was playing ping pong
against a wall and in between shots
he pounded his chest and bugled the
shrill call of the he-moose for its
mate. (Mate mine a blond). Suddenly Rufus Rayne rolled on the
stage was picked up by_ Blimp
bounced three times and tossed in a
basket from which point of vantage
he shouted “Clear the floor for Miss
Phillip Without a Ray of Hope”.

Burning Gallstone in his office
ceased scratching his head and threw
a switch, or his chest, or both, out
the wnidow. -Whereupon the three
golfers were engulfed by a trap door.
Du Venom slid down a sarcastic steel
chute into the store where he sat
looking into a coffe cup, “You are
coffee aren’t you?” he murmured in
a foreign accent. “For a moment I
thought you were mud”.

Sweet little Gloomytrees snakehipped up to Du Venom, got her
eye-lash-fluttering apparatus in motion and quoth, “quelle homme vous
etes (Watta man you are?) the
girls in the Hall love your mustache”.

Du Venom turned a deep violet
and fell back into a murky vat of
Roy’s coffee where he drowned,
maybe?

Spring Dance

Miss Without-a-Ray-of-Hope did
her accustomed spring dance onto
the gym floor stopped abruptly and
assumed a pose of Venus de Milo but
did not know what to do with her
arms. She was apparently mesmorized at the sight of Rufus in a

guess ?—nope you’re wrong—“home
on the range”.

“Would somebody remove that obstructian from the bawsket I’d rawther like to get on with my Clawss”
said Ray-of-Hope as she put her
hand to her head, distracted no
doubt.

Kissy Cameron nimbly leaped forward and recited:

Roses are red

Frosh are goofy

I pity the girl

Who marries you, Rufy.

Suddenly Fizzleque, that stumble
in the March of Time, staggered forward and delivered the asounding
news that six she-moose or meese
were killed by a C.P.R. freight while
on their way to Halifax in answer
to the Blimp McTwitchiemating call.

Say what goes on here anyway.
Will there be cocktail lounges in
Halifax? Did Du Venom drown?
I guess those Beaver’s just don’t
give a damn.

considered by the Council to be a
very definite improvement over the
old method, which did not give the
one honoured a sufficient recognition. The members of the Malcolm
Award Committee were next elected:
Dr. Bell and Dr. Wilson were reappointed faculty members, and Shirley
Kirkpatrick, George Corston, and
Fred Barton were appointed front
the student body.

The Sodales Budget was next presented by Otto Antoft. The final
business of the meeting was the
presentation of a budget by Delmar
Amiro, secretary of the Canadian
Students Assembly as a separate

organization, which has never been:

done before. This gave rise to a
‘prolonged discussion, the result of
which is that the C.S.A. is to present
a brief outlining its program at the
next meeting of the Council.

Freddy Barton, our president of
the students’ council was elected last
year after a close contest with Doug
McKean, has created a new interest
in council affairs and done more to
interest the students in the college
than’ any privy before him. As you
probably know, Freddy was largely
responsible for the super festivities
before, during, and after the Caledonia game and deserves.a big hand
for that job alone. With high school
and two years Arts under his belt,
he came to Dal, decided on medicine
and so he graduates next year.

Freddy has been president of Class
38, was two years representing that
class on the council and was member
at large on the Students’ Council for
a year. He was manager of the
Dal Tennis Club last year and at one
time was secretary-treasurer of the
Newman Club. Freddy, in sports,
is entremely proud of an Interfaculty
Hockey award which he got playing
for Medicine. Dalhousie’s Mr. Barton has not had a chequered or
brilliant career at college but gets
his spot in the Hall of Fame for
“services rendered.”

Ralston Trains
Hoopsters

With a week of their training
period already over, Dalhousie
basketball players are fast getting
in shape for the coming cage season.
The Tigers have the jump on other
city league teams by a full two
weeks, and Coach Burnie Ralston
hopes to have the collegians in great
shape when the season opens.
year the Tiger management have

again entered in both the senior and

intermediate loops.

The teams will be managed by
Walter Lawson and coached by
Burnie Ralston. The latter played
with Dal Tigers several years ago
when they won the Maritime title.
Last year he was a member of Saint
John seniors when they defeated
Acadia Axemen for the Maritime
crown.

Expected to be the big gun for the
Bengals this year is lanky Ben
Wilson, playing-coach with Acadia
University last season, and a firststring guard. Lining up alongside
Wilson will be Norm MacRitchie,
last year with King’s intermediates.
In addition, practically all of last
year’s regulars are again turning out
to practice, including Mike Smith,
Cal Seaman, Art Shanehouse, Rod
Ideson, “Clutch” MacKimmie, Johhny
Martin, and Alex Hart. With the
exception of Hatfield, all of last
year’sintermediates are back again,
and with several members of the
H. C. A. quintet, will form a strong
team for the intermediate league.

Blades Flash As
Tigers Work Out

Dalhousie hockey players, intending to enter the proposed city intermediate league and to participate
in intercollegiate competition this
year, have held a number of workouts at the Forum during the past
week under the capable direction of
Pete MacDonald, who is this year
coaching Tigers.

- The workouts have so far been
well attended, showing increased
enthusiasm in hockey at the college
this year. Between thirty and forty
players have turned out each practice, with more to come. Last year’s
team has not been hard hit by
graduation, Harry Smith, “Pooh”
DeWolfe, and Don MacGregor being
the only absentees from the 1938
senior squad, while Harry Smith and
Ted Gordon will be missing from the
intercollegiate team.

The new material which Coach
MacDonald will pick from is greater
both in quality and in quantity than
in previous years. Marty MacDonald
former St. Mary’s player is out with
the Tigers ‘this year, along with
several other Halifax high school
players, and two or three from Upper Canadian schools.

Both Munro and Koretsky, goalies
for the senior and _ intermediate
teams last year, are available for
duty again this season. Aspirants
for defence positions include J.
Feindel, Doug MacDonald, Webster
MacDonald, and several of last
year’s squad who have not turned
out to practice as yet but who will
come out the latter part of the week.
Candidates for forward positions include Corston, Blois, Thomas, Dickie,
MacGregor, Black, Whyte, Miller.

The fololwing players have seen
action in practice so far: John Dickie
George Corston, Bob Blois, Bill
Thomas, Ian MacGregor, Marty MacDonald, Pete McCollough, Webster
MacDonald, Bain Munro, Sandy MacDonald, Churchill Smith, Blanchard
| Wiswell, Roy Black, John Whyte,
George Miller.

OE RE EY ET
BASKETBALL

Practices are going on this year
at a great rate, with an average of
about twenty girls at each practice,
Miss Wray is certainly’ making everyone work at these turnouts, so
we expect to see lots of good play‘ing this year.

Medicine. 20
Engineers, 1

Law, 29
Arts & Science, 29

 

Medicine won their first victory in
the interfaculty basketball loop last
Thursday when they defeated the
Engineers by a score of 20-15. In
the second game of the day, Law
and Arts and Science battled to a
29-all draw, to go into a first place
tie.

The Engineers, who were playing
their initial game of the season,
found it difficult to get going as
their attacks were repeatedly broken
up the Med guards. At half-time
the Meds held a three point lead.

Play throughout the second period
was fairly. even the teams matching
basket for basket. On one occasion,
the Engineers trailed by a bare
point, but a quick basket by Chernin,
who sank a total of 10 points, gave
the Meds a three-point lead. Engineers fought hard right up to the
final whistle, but the Medical squad
had too much scoring power and
held a five-point lead as the whistle
blew.

The Arts & Science—Law contest
was a much better game to watch,
play being wide open from start to
finish. With Clarence Fraser leading
the attack, the Studley squad went
into an early lead, as they combined
a nice shooting and passing attack
to score regularly. The lawyers
coudn’t get going, at half time they
were behind 22-12.

However, the second period was a
different story as the Law hoopsters
clicked for the opening whistle to
cut the Artsmen’s lead, and to earn
a draw as the final whistle blew.

Medicine—Charman 8, Chernin 10,
Wilson 2, Bethune, Perlin.

Engineers—Walters, Vail 6, MacAlden 7, James 2, Smith, Sylvester.

Law — Anderson 6, Stewart 2,
Lyall, MacKenzie 4, Piercey 8,
Hutchins 2, MacRitchie 7.

Arts & Science — Dunbrack 4,
Grant 6, MacKean, Fraser 11, Harrison, Whyte 4, Burchell 2.

when you consider that Picobac is the pick of

Ramblings

By
Doug Cameron

 

 

With a very successful football

season finished, Dalhousie sportsmen are now looking to the future.
Large squads are already practicing
in both hockey and basketball with
a view to being in tip-top shape
when the season opens.

The hockey teams, intermediate
and intercollegiate, are under the
capable mentorship of Pete MacDonald, well known in the Maritime for his coaching ability. Sitting in the manager’s seat is the
ever-smiling “Tabo” MacNeil, a
hard worker, and a true Dalhousie
supporter. Although J. C. is perhaps a mite inexperienced, we
think that he has the “stuff”, and
working with Pete MacDonald,
will produce an outfit of championship calibre. So the best of
luck to you, Cameron!

* * *

The tentative opening date for
the hockey loop is slated for sometime early in January. To get the
boys in the best possible shape for
their opening league game, practices
will be held at least twice weekly
up until Christmas, with one practice scheduled for the Christmas
holidays. Those turning out for the
teams are urged to keep their eyes
on the notice boards, in order to
know when practices are being held.

present physical director, Burnie
Ralston, who has played on seyveral championship teams and who

Turning to our own basketball
squads, it looks as if we will have
two very fine teams this year. Un
der the experienced eye of Coach’

Ralston, over thirty aspirants have
been working out for the past two
weeks, and they show great promise.
At the last practice it was announced that the squad would be cut
shortly, in order to facilitate better
team practice.
