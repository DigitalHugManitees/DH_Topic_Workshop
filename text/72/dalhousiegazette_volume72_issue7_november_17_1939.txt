The Voice
Of Youth

“NEW ADVANCE” DRIVE

Under the chairmanship of Irene
Pentz, a local committee, representing at least eight youth organizations, met two nights ago to plan a
circulation drive, part of the nationwide campaign of the “New Advance” magazine, non-commercial,
non-profit organ of Canada’s major
youth associations.

Launched in October 1939 by the
unpaid efforts of student and youth

group members, the magazine seeks

student committee members, Charlie

|and Inez Smith, features such topics

as sport, books, war review, arms
profiteering, French-Canadian polities, etc., written by some of Canada’s most prominent young men.

Reaching at present one out of
every hundred Canadians, the “New
Advance” hope to boost circulation
by 7,000 copies before Dec. 15th.
Locally, weekly supper meetings of
youth group representatives will
help promote a vigorous subscription campaign.

 

NEWFOUNDLAND CLUB

There will be a meeting of the
Newfoundland Club on Sunday,
November 19th, in the Men’s
Common Room in the Arts Building. Plans have been made for a

_ VISITOR FROM THE ANDES

discussed his three-months expedition which covered over two thousand miles of territory from 6,000
to 16,500 feet in altitude.

Travelling with a caravan of fourteen mules, they encountered particularly bad weather conditions,
snow flurries and thunderstorms occurring almost every day, despite
the fact that it was the dry season.
Fossilic remains of the great megathorium were noted, flocks of sheep
were encountered each day, and if
the eye was very quick, Inca shepherds, who, preyed on through the
centuries, hide at the first sign of
a stranger.

We must be mindful of the fact,
said Fisher, that so far from making the world safe for democracy
and ending war, the last conflict
fostered dictatorship and became
the cause of another war. Accordingly, Canada must make her
contribution to the present war in
such a way as to be in accordance
with democracy and in keeping
with true Canadian Unity, mindful
of the 55% of her population
which are not of British origin.
Passing on to a discussion of
Canadian needs, Fisher deplored our
tendency as Canadians to ape the
English when we should be developing an admiration for Canadian
institutions. While agreeing that
England was worthy of admiration,
he pointed out the evidence of far
more emotion over English things
than Canadian, urging that we get
rid of this hangover from Colonial
days.

in 1931 graduated from Dal, one of

the National Executive Committee
of the Canadian Student Assembly
this week. Preparations are being

of some two hundred delegates, and
twenty-five leaders from faculties
and from public life.

“National Unity and Education”
has been selected by the Conference
Committee as the theme, and about
this the program has been drawn

ticular attention to the four topics
of “National Unity and Nationhood”, “Canada in World Affairs”,
“Extending University Education”
and “Improving University Education”.
problems as they affect the university body will be the order of the
day, with resource leaders giving
assistance when called on.

Thirty campuses from Charlottetown to Victoria will be represented.
A large French-Canadian delegation
has been assured. The National Executive Committee reports that already several of the local assemblies have asked that their delegations be increased.

FRESHMEN
GIVE FINE
DISPLAY

| Last night the Freshman show,
made up of variety turns and a oneact play, was presented at the Dal
‘gym. This critic has seen many
| variety shows on the Dal stage, most
of which were dead flops and dismal
failures. The humor was never particularly funny and the players did,
what is essential in variety, get their
personalities across the footlights to
the audience. But last night was
different. There was only one skit
reminiscent of other times; that was
the one called “The Classroom”.

 

Personality Plus

All the other number were good—
very good. They were snappy, they
were funny, and, best of all, the kids
“had something” and let the audience
know it. There wasn’t a self-conscious face among the lot. But to
proceed to particulars.

Alex Macintosh distinguished himself as Prof. Bennet. As Alex said
just before going on the stage:—“I
shall remember ‘this moment all my
life for I may never appear so like
so great a man again.”

Dorothy Graham’s dance spots
were good and had that little professional touch which is so nice to
see in an amateur performance. hTe
same thing might be said about
Gordon Waugh’s playing—and did I
hear a whisper in the back, girls,
during his number like: “Who is he?
Isn’t he cute?”

dollars, it was stated by the Conference Committee. This will give
assistance to the delegations from
the far West and the far East, who
otherwise would not be able to be
present.

Discussion outlines and preparation material are in the press, while
leaders will be announced in the
near future.

due for hearty congratulations.
When they appear on the operatic

“Stuffand Nonsense” was another
bright spot and so was the “Meditation de Danse’.’ The take-off of the
“low lurch” was very appropriate—

SADIE HAWKINS ON SPOT

Edmonton, Alta.—Sadie Hawkins
has been causing an uproar on the
University of Alberta campus. The
university authorities refused to
ratify student plans for a Sadie
Hawkins week, due to existing
statutes of the university forbidding
unofficial and spontaneous social
functions unless they are organized
through the Student’s Council. The
students protested and opinion took
a definite turn toward the support of
a week of co-ed dating. The six-day
program was carried out as originally planned, in spite of the official
opposition. The rebellious spirit
crystallised early in the week in
the form of a handbill reading
“Students, demand your rights. Run
your own social affairs without interference. Support Sadie Hawkins.”
The author of the handbill was not

known, but at last hearing his advice
was being universally followed.
Jack Dewis, Union President, outlined the stand of the Council by
announcing that the Board of Goyernors had stated they would not
sanction a Sadie Hawkins Week, and
neither would the Executive Council;
and further, that any members of
the Students Union who violated the
liberties of any other student by
attempting to enforce any provision
contained in the so-called Sadie

Hawkins Week Act would be sub-|.

mitted to the Enforcement Committee.

In defiance, co-ed dating is going
on unhindered. A “Sadie’s Aid” has
been established in the men’s resi
scripts

C. A. S. Scholarships

The Canadian Student Assembly
is sponsoring a drive in New Brunswick Universities to make Scholarships for universty students a real
issue in the next provincial elections.
Mount Allison has been asked to cooperate with the other New Brunswick Universities in bringing to.the
attention of the candidates for the
Provincial Government the great
need for more scholarships for university students. It is hoped that
this project of the C.S.A. will be
attended with the success of its

Registration Figures
Received at Last

Figures about the number of students registered at Dalhousie for
the session 1939-40 have just been
received by the Gazette. It seems
from these figures that every province except Alberta is represented
on the campus this year. Besides
Canadians we have 21 students from
Newfoundland, 3 from the British
Isles, 5 from the U. S., 2 from
the British West Indies and 3 from
other foreign countries.

Significantly the number of students from the United States declines each year. The total drop im

those interested in social problems
might have a chance to make their

It was also hoped that students
would gain a better idea of the social
laboratory from which writers on
sociology, economics, social psychology and (other) allied subjects receive their data. It was felt that
students in the social sciences did
not gain enough practical experience
in their own fields. The people who

From a report on the Labor

“The Canadian Seaman’s Union increased wages to 22.50 a month and
had the hours reduced to twelve. On
the Great Lakes the aim is to establish an 8-hour day which would
bring 7,000 men into work, but the
difficulty is that foreign ships are

them. At present there are 180 Norwegian ships in the Great Lakes.”

and fish dripping with water (which
should have been drained from them)
looked and smelt particularly unappetizing.”

These extracts are few and scanty
but the detailed report may be borrowed from Jackie Cahan or from
the S.C.M. bookshelf in the library.

On the last evening of the lab.
there were speakers from the various political parties in Canada who
tried to give their party’s views on
how those problems covered in the

lab. might be solved. It is impera-|

tive that these problems should be
solved if we are ever to have a lasting peace but solutions will only
come through study and exertion.
Peace wiil not be gained through
wishful thinking nor through letting
the other fellow do the dirty work.
A study group is being formed to
carry on the work started last year.
Anyone who is interested in peace
is welcome!

No More Latin?

Montreal, P. Q.— Welcome news
to almost any student on any campus is the conclusion reached by an
educational commission at McGill
University. Reginald Louthood,
chairman, re-stated the opinion of
the commission. Instead of individually required courses in the first
vear, such as Latin, Mathematics,
English, etc., a choice of courses |
should be offered from each of four
main divisions—the Biological Sciences, the Physical Sciences, the
Humanities, and the Social Sciences.

Latin should not be compulsory,
was the further opinion of the commission, ‘since those who wished to
take it would select it as their choice
of the Humanities. This attitude toward the study of Latin should be
music to the ears of all who have
unwillingly, and perhaps unnecessarily suffered through one or two
years of Latin anywhere.

Many of the business and professional men of the city attended the

MAKE “MINERS” RUM
or Tonight the Birds Will Scream.

Blurbie Stewpot and Jock McCluskie were endeavoring by logical
standards to determine the nature
“fush”, namely, Rufus
Rufus, hearing the frantic
squeals of Minna from the beach,
reached into the bottom of Blurbie’s
rowboat, picked up a bloated codfish, handed off Blurbie, dodged the
bulky Jock and with increasingly
powerful strokes floated towards
shore. He evaded a flying tackle of
Minna’s which Engineers would call
a “pass”, and ployed on to the football field where the Caledonia Miners
had dug themselves in near a goal
line by means of sharp-edged and
well-timed remarks.

Rufus was late. As he ran down
the side lines he bumped into Blimp
MacTwitchie; there was a demonstration of an elementary principle
of physics and Rufus carromed into
the base drum, where he remained
to deaden the noice.

Major Catfish had drawn up his
troops along the sidelines to prevent any Miners from taking the
referee home as a souvenir, because
they already had the cup. There
was a momentary pause and a befuddled stew stumbled in front of
the troops at an angle of forty-five
degrees, burbling, “Get back there,
children”. Seeing the hazy outline
of Platoon Three, who were in zigzag formation anyway, the stew
having ziged once and zaged in the
middle, informed them in accents

“Shay, boysh, I got a new drink.”
At these words Platoon Three came
violently to life and Sargy Bawlson
took up thes pose of a pointer dog

“What is it?” chorused Platoon
Three.

“Take

“Say, he’s pretty drunk, isn’t he?”
quoth Private MacGinty admiringly.

“Aw, I’m pretty all the time,”
answered the stew as he passed out
with an ease that made Caporal
Corky and Catfish green with envy.
Three freshettes, who were wearing
their green about the gills, were

shocked and rushed home to tell |

Minna all about it.

WHAT TIME IT WAS

“What’s the score?” shouted Mac| Twitchie, who was now in a complete coma.

“The Miners have now won three
cases before Lord Chief Justice
Avidson,” answered McGimmie, who
was counsel for the Tigers. “‘And I
shall give notice of appeal to the
Supreme Moot Court of Dalhousie in
all three cases.” And the Lord
Chief Justice put the whistle in his |
brief case and retired from the
bench,

Just then there was a terrific
scrimmage in center field and Rufus
threw his codfish to Snow-white, who
fumbled and a free kick was awarded against the Tigers. Burning
Gallstone was mad; in fact, he was

This week’s question goes back to
a suggestion made by President
Barton at the last Students’ Forum,
about the possibility of having informal dances in the gym on Saturday nights, music to be provided by
the “Wurtilizer’’.

Bob Mussett, Freshman—‘“Sure, I
think it’s a good idea. It would be
nica to be able to drop in at the
gym and dance for a while after the
show. It’s getting pretty late to
start it now ,though.”

John Wiswell, ist year medical
student—“It’s a great idea! Why
don’t “they” do something about it?
It?s too close to Christmas to get
anything started this term.”

Don Kirkpatrick, Freshman —
“Sounds all right. Doesn’t affect me.
Don’t think Shirley’d get much kick
out of it—probably wouldn’t bother
going over.”

Penny Patchell, Science ’42—
an idea. I don’t know if it would
work—too many people go to supper dances and things. It’s worth
trying for at least a couple of weeks,
though—but after Christmas!”

Ian MacGregor, 2nd year medical
student — “(Censored) fine idea! I
shall co-operate to the utmost.
(ahem) I think that covers ths
subject.”

Miss Boswell and Miss Tregunno,
Freshettes,—refused to express an
opinion when interviewed. (Columnist’s note: Quite right—freshettes
have no business having opinions
anyway—it spoils their charm).

Donald “Pinky” Smith, Freshman
— “Yeah, good idea. I wouldn’t
care to say anything about it.”

_ alumni will be on the roster.

The Sieh have reas paused
Sora hanging up their football
boots to putting on the blades in
anticipation of one of the best hoc_ key seasons seen at the University
for some time. If things materialize
when the boys return after the holi
_ days, a six-team intermediate league

_ will be well under way. Besides the
_ Tigers, there will be seen in action
_ teams from the Tramways, King’s,
Royal Bank, Dartmouth, and a suburban aggregation, in all probability
Rockingham. This is a_ tentative
schedule at present, but the idea of
a six-team circuit of some kind is
fairly definite.

Wednesday marked the first workout. Pete MacDonald, well known
in provincial hockey, is to coach the
Bengals this year. Under his watchful eye roughly thirty aspirants for
the team drove themselves from end
to end of the Forum. The first
practice naturally was somewhat
ragged, but there were definite
signs of able material none the less.

Especially good was the turn-out}
_ from the freshmen, who in years to

come will be a tower of strength to
Dal.

The following players saw action
Wednesday night: John Dickie,
George Corston, Bob Blois, Bill
Thomas, Ian MacGregor, Marty
MacDonald, Pete MacCulloch, Webby Macdonald, Bain Munro, Sandy
MacDonald, Churchill Smith, Blanchard Wiswell, Roy Black, John
Whyte, George Miller, etc,

Artsmen Whip

Commerce

The champion Arts and Science
basketball quintet were victorious in
their first start of the season when
they swamped a weak Commerce
team by a score of 27-4 in the gym
last Thursday.

With practically none of last
year’s team missing, the Arts and
Science squad carried the play to the
Commerce team from the start of
the game, and opened up an early
10-0 lead. The Commerce squad,
playing together for the first time,
found it hard to hit their stride and
their shots on the basket were repeatedly knocked down by a strong
Arts and Science defence.

Arts & Science—Fraser 10, Hennigar 9, Grant 4, Whyte 2, McKeen
2, Cleveland.

Commerce: Blois, Miller, Thomas,
Doig 2, Cameron 2, Matthew, Mitchell, Godden, Scrymageour.

Law - - 38
Med - - 17

Medicine started off fast and
scored on two quick baskets by Ben
Wilson. But once the Law machine
started to roll, the Meds could do
nothing about it, and the lawyers
sifted through a wide-open Med
defence to score easily. With Hutchins leading the attack, the Law
cagers really went to town and at
the half-way mark had a 22-6 lead.

In the second half, however, the
Meds put up a much better battle
and were only outscored by 5 points.
Wilson led the attack, both on the
defensive and offensive, to count a
total of seven points in this half,
while MacRitchie was the big man
for Law. The final whistle blew with
the Law squad still rolling up points,
breaking through a tired Med de
 

| fence.

 

Frosh Cash In On
Commerce, 22-13

The Commerce-Freshman game
produced a much slower brand of
ball. The Commerce squad was content to sit back and wait for the
breaks, and for awhile this strategy
paid dividends.

But the second half was a different
story. Failure of Commerce to mark
their men closely allowed the Frosh
forwards to slip through for several
easy lay-up shots. The Freshmen
went into the leading from the
whistle and were never headed, McKenzie and Mosher playing a great
game at the guard positions, as they

desperation John Bird tried a drop

wide of the bars by a few feet. A
bit later Chernin missed another attempt at a field-goal. The Dal scrum
kicked a high punt and followed up
fast, to force a scrum onthe 10yard line, but Murrant dribbled the
ball in touch at mid-field to relieve
the pressure.

Two minutes before the end of the
game, Chernin tried another drop
kick but it was wide also. The Dal Donald.

POST MORTEM

 

We watched the Tigers bow out
to Caledonia last Saturday at Studley and we still feel that Dalhousie
has the better team. The gold and
black squad had a decided edge in
play throughout the game, but inability to cash in on several nice
scoring opportunities was responsible for the Tigers failing to score.

The cause for the Tiger defeat
may, in our opinion, be ascribed to
the backfield’s taking the ball standing still. As it was, the Miners’
three-quarter line covered the Dal

backfield like a blanket, and at
tempts to run the ball were disastrous. Why, we would like to know,
didn’t the Tigers kick over the
heads of their opponents when they
found they were covered so closely ?

Placing no blame on any single
player for last Saturday’s defeat,
we still think that Dalhousie this
year had the best team of any in
the past years. So we take this opportunity of congratulating the football team, one and all, for the great
showing they made in the City
League, and for a courageous game
against the Miners.

League Championship for the Bengals.

The Tigers will be greatly
strengthened by the addition of
Benny Wilson, lanky guard who has
played with Acadia Axeman for
the past several years. In addition,
the squad has not been hard hit by
graduation and there is plenty of
new material, some of it appearing
pretty good to us.

Lack of practice has been the
cause of the poor showing during
the past several years, but this
year, according to Manager Lawson,
who is out after a championship,
the teams will work out regularly
thrice weekly. Remember, boys,
practice makes perfect!

ing very well and scoring one goal
apiece. In the second period, however, there was a slackening in the
play and the game became rather
sloppy, especially on the Dal side.
During this half Edgehill managed
to score three more goals, making
the final score 4-1 in their favour.

This was the last game with Edgehill for this season, but both games
were good and the players seemed
to enjoy them very much. We look
forward to games with Edgehill
next year.

After the game there was a tea
at Shirreff Hall for the players of
both teams.

 

NOTICE—There will be a meeting of the D.G.A.C. Tuesday noon,
