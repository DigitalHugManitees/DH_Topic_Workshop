net to vote the sum of $597.50 for meals for the basketball team.
This was the main item of business on a crowded agenda presented

by President Clint Havey.

A committee had been appointed to study

the matter and had found that noon-hour was the only convenient

time for the practise.

The new Pharos constitution,
drawn up by Bill Mingo, Bill
Pope and Jim Bell was approved
by the council. Applications for
business manager of the year
book will be received by Clint
Havey or the sec-treas. of the
Students’ Council before Nov.

of the dance committee, gave a
report and the council recom‘mended that the committee. arrange ‘regular Saturday night
dances. It was proposed to have
Don Warner’s orchestra in attendance.

Al. Blakeney, chairman of the
gate receipts committee gave a
report on the football games and
Bill Mingo gave a report on the
Acadia trip. - \

The president of the D.A.A.C.,
Dave Doig, presented several
items to the council. The home
and home football series between Caledonia and Dalhousie
was called off because it could
not be held on the dates planned.
It was voted to send a tennis
team to play McGill in the Camadian Intercollegiate Tennis
matches. President Havey pointed out that the tennis team deserved this trip in the light of
its achievements in the past, and
& sum, not to exceed $500.00
was voted for this purpose. In

Capitalism
Antiquated
Lewis Says

October 30 — Approximately
ninety Dal students assembled

 

in the Munro room today to hear

the National Secretary of the
C.C.F. say, “. . .. the concentration of wealth and power that
modern economy creates has
reached the stage where it
should no longer be left in the
hands of the owners of basic industries.”’

“In any discussion of society
and socialism,” Mr. Lewis stated,
“people question socialism because of the strong, inner prejudice against change.”

“Today,” the speaker continued, “any thinking man in society is searching for that which
we have not. Democracy is
worthwhile, but it must progress,
and in doing so there are only
two alternatives, either to improve the capitalist system or to
develop democratic socialism.
My conviction, which is based on
experience and study of economics and politics, is that there is
no way to improve the capitalistic system; na way to avoid re

The second inter-faculty debate of the year was held -in
Room 8, Arts Building, Tuesday
evening, with eighteen in attendanc Arts and Science, the
winning team, comprised of Art
Moreira, John McCormick and
Whitney Dalrymple, upheld the
affirmative of the resolution that
“a liberal education is more
necessary for use today than a
practical one,”- against the En

Cameron and Vie Sulsky.

Art Moreira, first speaker for
Arts and Science, said that liberal arts were suppressed too
much in schools and of the advantages that could be gained if

the Engineers, brought in points
concerning the value of a practical education in and out of college, and how one could get to

know students better by taking

a course such as Engineering

to get to know your fellow Engineers). Bob Cameron argued
for use of practical Science in

BOLIVIAN
STUDENTS
IN REVOLT

“There have been one hundred
and fourteen revolutions in the
past hundred and tewenty seven

years”, Rev. Sydney Hilliard of
Bolivia told the students of
Spanish, Friday afternoon. Introduced by Professor ©. H.

Mercer, he has spent the past
twenty four eyars in Bolivia and
is well informed on conditions in
that country.

Rev. Hilliard spoke of the
present Revolution, and the part
Played by the students in the
Revolution. He went on to say
that the students have been blamed for the death of the President,
but that there is no proof that
this is true.

“The South Americans are not
a cruel people,” he said. When
the Nazi Party came into power
in December 1943 they treated
their opponents in such a manner
that the South Americans were
shocked.

As a result of the July Revolution a new Cabinet has been
formed. This Cabinet will be in
power until December when a new
one will be elected by the people,
Rey. Hilliard told the students
concluding his address.

 

Linquists
Required

On Friday morning Professor
C. H. Mercer introduced to the
students in Spanish I, Mr. P. L,
H. Musclamp, M. A., who gave
the students an interesting talk
on his experiences as’a member
of the O. S. S. (Office Strategic
Service) attached to the American
Army in Europe, and subsequently as the Chief Intelligence Investigator of “Greater Hesse’”’ in
the American Zone in Germany.

Having worked with the O.S.S.
in Italy, Sweden, France, and
Austria, where he remained until
the end of the war, Mr. Musclamp
was very well informed on current
opinions throughout Europe.

Mr. Musclamp, spoke on the
conditions in Germany and the
need for a better understanding
between France, Russia, and
England in regard to- the zone
partitions.

In closing Mr. Musclamp told

the students that there are posi-:

tions open for anyone with a
speaking knowledge of the German Language.

Extra Classes—

At noon, on Thursday, October
24, 1946, Professor Adshead conducted the meeting arranged to
see what hours were best suited
to the majority of Veterans seeking extra help in Math. 1. The
meeting took place in Room 3 of
the Arts and Science building,
where approximately one hundred
students attended. After some
discussion, it was agreed. to conduct these classes in Room 3 from
2-3 p.m. Monday and Thursday
afternoons of each week.

Thursday’s class got away to a
fine start. Monday’s class, with a
week-end’s research behind them,
found many more questions being
asked and good answers received.
All who attend these extra classes
are very pleased with the idea.

 

 

At the first meeting of the
citizens’ Forum the following
members were elected rotating

chairmen for the year 46-47:
Messrs. Foohey, Smith, Boite and
Milley. The secretary, Mr. J.
Laughton, announced the topic for
the night: Are strikes necessary?

After the broadcast tea was

served and the discussion was
started by Mr. Milley on _ the
question: Should strikes be prohibited by law? After vigorous

argument the meeting directed
the Secretary to record the following decision: That the right of
tradesmen to strike is at present
indisputable, and similar to the
right of self-defence in a pioneer
society. Only those strikes which
endanger vital social functions
should be prohibited.

After this discussion, the chairman, Mr. Foohey, rose to welcome
Mr. Jack Dacey, Assist. Secretary
of the Nova Scotia Trades and

Right To Strike
Is Indisputable

 

 

Labor Council. Mr. Foohey recalled that Mr. Dacey had been
the Chairman of the Forum last
year, and welcomed him back.
The next question dealt with
the likelihood of industrial peace
being promoted through the win
ning of union security. There
was a hot debate over this,
Messrs. MacCormick and O’Neil

being the principal dissenters. A.
slim majority carried the motion
that: Union security will only of

itself eliminate certain types of
strikes, not strikes in general.
The meeting then discussed

generally ways and means of preventing strikes while protecting
both labor and management.
Votes of thanks were proposed to
Dr. Richter, Mr. Dacey and the
ladies who prepared the tea. The
meeting also directed the Secretary to call to the attention of the
Student Council the lack of radios
on the campus. Then the meeting adjourned.

EDITOR'S
MAIL.

DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS
Camp Hill Hospital,

Halifax, N. S.

July 9, 1946

   

Mr. C. B. Havey,
President,

Council of the Students,
Dear Sir:

Your letter of June 30th, addressed to Supervisor of Training,
D. V. A., Mr. J. H. Read, has
been forwarded to this office for
reply since the subject matter
deals mainly with medical care.

2. We would odvise that the
Department of Veterans’ Affairs
regulations provide for active
medical treatment and _ hospitalization if necessary, for any incidental illness or emergency
condition which may develop in
any veteran during the period in
which he is attending ’a course of
study or training under the Rehabilitation Branch of the D. V.
A. Hospitalization would be provided at Camp Hill Hospital, and
if necessary, the facilities of the
Out Patient Clinic may be used
by such students in lieu of the
University Health Service, which
may not cover a wide enough
Scope to provide complete investigation of certain types of
minor illness.

3. The Out Patient Clinic
facilities are available at Camp
Hill Hospital daily between 9 and
1 and between 2.30 and 5 on
week days, except Saturday afternoon. This medical service is
available to students attending
University under the Rehabilitation Branch during the whole
period of their authorized courses,
regardless of whether or not such
a.period includes the one year
post discharge treatment to which
all veterans are normally entitled.
It however does not cover illness
or injury sustained during summer vacations and normally does
not cover such illnesses as T. B.
or other semi-permanent disabilities, which would have to be
specially authorized by Head
Office.

4. A pensioner is of course
entitled to treatment for lifetime
for his pensioned disability, or on
grounds of meritorious service,
and under certain financial circumstances for other remediable conditions.

5. The various other conditions of treatment in special cases
eannot be detailed in a letter, but
the undersigned will be glad to
discuss any particular cases, or
the whole situation in general, at
any time, if further information
as desired.

, Ygurs very truly,
(signed) C. J. Macdonald, M. D.,
CJM|B Med. Asst. to D. A.

LETTER TO EDITOR
Dear Sir:

It is sharply depressing to read
an article such as that which appeared in the last.two ,issues of
the Gazette under the title of
“Our Upright Selves’ When in
the fifth month of the Year Two
A. B. a university student can
write in such a vein it shows that
civilization is not making the adjustwrents necessary for survival
in the atomic age.

The anonymous author of your
article has done his little bit to
widen the gap between Russia and
the western powers. Does he
not realize that friendship and
understanding between the peop
les of Russia and the West must

be established to an unprecedented degree if a third world war is
to be prevented? Does he not realize that the war to which he is
working will kill not only himself,

All students are advised to
keep their parents off the campus
for the next couple of weeks anyway, that is if they want to attend the super-colossal Med Dance
on November 8th. Have you
seen those posters? Most of the
male members of the student
body would be interested to know
who posed for the drawings.

All this, and the medical men
are only charging a dollar a
couple for the melee. Don Warner’s Orchestra will supply the
music, and it looks as if the dance
will really be a smashing success.

Don’t forget; Friday, November 8th., from 9.00 to 12.00 in
the Gym.

Request For
Campus Hams

The Gazette office has been) informed of an active amateur radio club at the University of British Columbia which desires radio
communication with any “ham’”’
student. (Radio experts can differentiate between what is desired
and what may be found at the
opening rehearsals of ‘Twelfth
Night’. )

The U.B.C. station is operating
daily with a 250 watt transmitter,
and by November it is expected
that a 500 watt transmitter will
be in operation.

It is possible that -there are
enough student “hams’’, or should

night at the second big Student
Council Dance of the term? From
all reports, it is going to be a
gala affair with music supplied by
Don Warner and his twelve-piece
dance band which is really tops
in entertainment.

This is the first appearance of
the complete band this term, and
what everyone has been looking
forward to. The Acadia trip made
its mark but almost everyone has
recovered by now, and a big
turnout ‘is expected.

That’s this Friday night, November ist., in the Gym. Dancing
is from 9.00 to 12.00 and admission is by Students’ Council Card.

Ting Challenges
Dare We Fail ?

It was not with a plea for pity toward the unfortunate of the
world that Rev. K. H. Ting confronted the group who met in the

Engineer’s Common Room on Sunday afternoon.

Rather, he gave a

challenge that is so important that it can be disregarded only at our

peril.

He brought the group face to face with the fact that we in

Canada are still a long way from doing our share in building a better

world.

He pointed out that life here

in Canada is too comfortable for
us to fully realize the suffering
and misery that is in the world
today. Students in Germany are
getting about 900 calories a day,
and the minimum requirement is
2000. It is true, many are Nazis,
but we cannot change them by
starving them.

In Canada we have an average
of about 3500 calories. It is
estimated that our standard of

REV. K. H. TING

 

living has gone up 14% above
the pre-war level. There is no
hope of having a peaceful world
very long while such inequalities
exist. They are bound to create
unrest if they are allowed to continue as they are.

Prevention of the third world
war is a hopeless ideal if we do
not accomplish more toward
alleviating the _ suffering.
amount we do depends on whether
the suffering of those people becomes real to those in the countries that are better off.

By extending our vision beyond eur borders we can see
ecnditions in other parts of the
world and it is necessary that we
feel an affinity with people of
other lands, It is up to students
to make a world Christian community. When we say “Our
Father who art in Heaven,” we
must think of others to whom he
is a Father just as much as to
us.

Mr. Ting closed with an appeal
for students to consider seriously their position in relation to
the rest of the world,—to ask
themselves the question, what
am I doing in the Urftverse? Have
I found what I can do to lift the
terrible burdens on others? What
can I do to alleviate some of the
suffering?

 

 

Army Stresses
Erudite C.0.T.C.

October 29 — At a meeting held today by Major Cameron, Commanding Officer of the Dalhousie Contingent of the C. O. T. C., a
group of interested students were informed that the Army has been
placing the stress on the need for highly educated officers.

The object of the Military Training Programme that has been
planned by the Corps is to qualify selected University Undergraduates
for a commission, on graduation, in Corps of the Canadian Army —
Active Force, Reserve Force, or Supplementary Reserve — depending
on the educational requirements of the particular Corps.

All students of Canadian Universities may apply to join the
Corps providing that they are
British subjects, between the
ages of eighteen and twenty-two,
with the exception of veteran
students who may be older and
are following a course of study
leading to a degree.

Dalhousie students may apply
to Major Cameron at the C. O. T.
C. Office in the gym building at
any time between 10.00 A. M.
and 5.00 P. M. during the first
three days of every week.

Members of the C.O.T.C. who.

successfully attend three summer
vacation periods will be qualified
as Captains, Reserve Force, or
Lieutenants, Active Force, subject to further training.
Members of the Corps who

vs

ir ;
aa
2

successfully attend two summer
vacation periods will be qualified
as Lieutenants, Reserve Force.

The limited number of students:
accepted for the Corps will be
appointed as Temporary Second
Lieutenants and will retain this
rank throughout the entire training period,

Members of the Corps shall
for each day of duty be entitled
to pay and allowances totaling
$135.00 per month, and lodging,
board and medical care. There
will be no pay for the ten hours
of theoretical training during the
first year; however, for each of
the second and third years of the
training programme, the student
will receive pay for both the
theoretical and practical phase.

Saturday, as their passing, tackling and kicking was up to the
standard which they should have
maintained all year, and which
proved that they have all the
necessary assets for a winning
combination, but the right formula has to be used in mixing these
assets.

Part of the credit for this win
belongs to Mel Sheppard, who
seemed to inspire the team to
their best efforts all through the
game, by appearing in the lineup
during the first half. Their new
sweaters also seemed to lend the
players new confidence, but, above
all, they decided to make their
best efforts as a team rather than
as individuals. This resulted in
giving them the fighting drive

from this writer for the column

They will wait a long time as I
stand by the statements and ideas
contained in that column, as regards the situation at that time.
I feel that no apology is necessary, unless it be from the play®

This brings us to Wednesday’s

McKenna’s boys for their win and
good luck to them in their quest
for the title.

As for the Tigers—if it
wouldn’t be too hackneyed, I
would ring the entire page in

did give a good exhibition, but the
team itself “should of stood in

that the team made a bad showing, when they did so. He felt
that the cheer leaders were the
ones to be chastened for the defeat, and this column had dealt
too harshly with the team, tearing down its morale, as he stated
in his letter.

Perhaps I have the wrong slant
but I feel that it is the job of this

sit back and praise bad faults or

Dal Girls Bowl

Over

 

Edgehill

“They also serve who only stand and (run)”’

 

DALHOUSIE hit a winning stride last Saturday as the Varsity Co.
eds handily defeated Edgehill in an exhibition Ground Hockey match
at Studley Field. The Dal girls showed a GREAT DEAL OF FORM

in posting this decisive win and special credit is due to Nancy Jones,

Pat Godfrey, and Joyce Hart for their fine performances.

A feature

of the game was the savage checking of the Dal defence, who literally
bowled over all opposition by a delicate twist of the hip.

 

Cubs Hold
St. Mary’s
Scoreless

Once again it has been proven
that teamwork, and only teamwork, is the essential in any game.
On Saturday, Oct. 26, Dal. Cub
fought St. Mary’s to a scoreless
tie. St. Mary’s had full control
of the scrum, plus an _ efficient
line, but the expert blocking,
kicking and tackling of the Cubs
made the line ineffective.

In the first half St. Mary’s had
the edge on the play, but could
not make the touch. However,
Graves of St. Mary’s caused the
Cubs many anxious moments with
his clever running.

Throughout the second half
the teams were holding the play
near each other’s lines. The expert heeling of Burke was a decided advantage for St. Mary’s.
Hartling of Dal. was injured early
in the second half and was replaced by MacAuley. Prime and
Graves of the Cubs deserve special mention for their playing and
both teams showed spirit and exercised great sportsmanship.

St. Mary’s: Preston, Burke,
Woods, Trainor, Jackman, McLellan, Graves, Hemoworta, Mann,
Reardon, McManus, Starton, McDougall, McComes.

Dal.: MacIntosh, Weir, Nicholas, Graves, Reynolds, Hartling,
Cochrane, Mingo, Prime, Leverman, Ferguson, McKelvey, Willis,
MacAulay.

 

feeling may not be mutual. There
are many reasons for their poor
showing which have no connection
with the players. I have not
stressed them, because I felt that
first things should come first. I
promise them that before the year
is out I will get to these factors,
unless improvements are forthcoming.

A large crowd was on hand to
witness the contest and the Dal
rooters exhibited an exhuberance
of spirit. They even ‘invented’
some inspiring yells for the opposition, to prove that they were
examples of true sportsmanship—

‘Knit one, drop four!
Edgehill! Score! Score!
‘Knit one, pearl two;
Edgehill! —- Woo! Woo!

When the smoke had cleared
away from the preliminary skirmishing, Pat Godfrey was discovered, uncovered, in front of
the Edgehill goal. Nancy Jones
immediately made a pass at Pat,
who pushed it beyond the outstretched fingers of Goalie Phyllis
Harris and Dal was one up at the
five minute mark.

Edgehill fought back with
tooth and nail but received the
cold shoulder treatment from the
Tigress defence. At this stage of
the game, the girls took time out
for some golf, with two of them
swinging at the ball at the same
time, although giving each other
the required notice—l, 2, 3,
FOUR, and ball and players took
off in varied directions.

Dal again took control of the
play and swept down the field,
on spectacular rushes by one of
the Jones’ girls, had a little tetea-tete with the Edgehill defence,
convinced them, and then (the
ball) took off for the right hand
corner of the net, only to be
stopped in flight by the outstretched limb of Miss Harris.
Pausing to glance at the scenery,
the ball returned to Nancy, who
pushed the reluctant pill right
back and Dal led 2-0.

At one point in the game, time
and Marie Bruce (plus her broken war club) were taken out, and
Patty MacKinnon was taken in.
Having taken a deep breath, the
game gathered up its courage, and
its skirts, and finished out the
half with no major casualties.

Time Out For Tea

Due to the presence in the Dal
line-up of some Hall girls, time
out for tea was allowed. After

Trounce Tigers,

St. Francis Xavier took the
Nova Scotia Intermediate Rugby
championship at Studley Field
Wednesday afternoon as_ they
overcame a disotganized team of
Dalhousie Tigers 12-0. The Tigers, after their upset win over
Navy last week, reverted to type,
and just couldn’t get going. At
the end of the first half it was
still a ball game, the score
standing at 3-0 for the visitors.
In the second half the Tigers
practically died, and the X-men
promptly sewed the game up
with two quick tries.

Dalhousie carried the ball into

game and the visitors experienced

a few anxious moments before
they relieved the pressure with
a few good kicks.
scrum was working adequately
at this stage, but fumbling was
widespread in the Dal backfield, and St. F. X. was quick to
capitalize on these lapses. Whenever the St. F. X. line got the
ball it worked smoothly, continually reversing their field and
unmolested by Dalhousie  tackling. After steady pressure
Ralph MacNeil scored for St.
F. X. Dalhousie, with the aid of
two fine penalty kicks by Alex
Farquhar put Dal close, but the
ball went over the dead-ball line,
and the chance was lost. For the

Putsch Organized In Room 2

By OSWALD §S. SEABISCUIT

Early in the month I received word from a reliable source that
the dread C. C. C. C. intended to establish a branch of that society at

Dalhousie.

Although awed by the risk, I decided to attend that

Society’s first meeting, and record their resolutions for posterity’s

sake.
shevik manner.

Accordingly, I allowed my beard to grow in the accepted Bol
This explains why, early last week, I cautiously made my way
through the dark corridors of the Arts Bldg., looking for Room 2.

Vulgar songs and coarse laughter echoed through the halls, and guided*
me to the concealed entrance of the room.

I entered and found my
self in the midst of a bevy of bulging Bolsheviki which would have

alarmed Lenin himself.

Some of them I recognized.
. There was Luke Muller of the
‘Frankfurt Putschists, and Gart
D. Schwartz was the chairman.
The room was full of them, most
with beards. All were fondling
various lethal weapons—bombs,
sabres of the Cossack type, penknives—and they were making
the very devil of a noise.

As I took in this scene I felt
a tap on my shoulder, and turned
to find myself looking down the
barre of a fountain-pen, with a
suspicious face behind it who
wanted my name, address and
Party affiliations. I gave him
these and a party card won in a
Residence poker game. The latter
seemed to pacify him.
_ At this point Chairman Schwartz
arose and announced the speaker:

Comrade Ollie Bakeapple, for
years leader of the insidiou’

Bilgeriver Anarchists, who for so
long have terrorized The Forrest
district. Bakeapple stood up. He
was short, plump and had an evil
leer,

“Comrades,” he began. ‘“Capitalists must go.” He paused to
let this statement sink in. “They
pour milk on the ground. They
burn firewood. They have depressions wrung from the lips of
the starving poor. They cultivate
stomach ulcers. They support the
reactionary system under which
exams are set. They must go.”

Here there were loud cheers,
and someone in the rear with a
surfeit of vodka muttered: “If
they gotta go, they gotta go.”
and was promptly purged. Bakeapple coughed.

“Have a cough drop?” the
chairman asked solicitously.
“Thanks.” Bakeapple took

three, He went on: “These capitalists have too much money. We
need more. The wealth of a
nation should not be placed in a
few ‘ands. ..I mean hands. As
Lord Bacon put it, money is like
muck, not good unless it be
spread.”

“Wot’s muck?” a beetle-browed conspirator whispered to his
neighbour. |
“S English for ‘bull’,’ the
a answered. “We gotta spread

Bakeapple was reaching his
peroration. . . “and, furthermore,
the C.C.C.C. program was placed
before the Politburo for approval.” He sat down amid loud
cheers.

“Did they approve of it?” I
asked incautieusly. A dead silence
followed my words. Even Lon
Clakoff, the Residence rabblerouser, stopped hiccupping. Menacing glances were cast in my
direction, and I heard whispers
of: “kill de bum,” “serag the
blighter,” ‘“‘bloody reactionary,”
and so forth. The chairman
hastily rose to thank the speakers. I shrunk slightly, and sat
still.

“And who may you be,” said
a Volga boatman sitting beside
me: “who do not know that. no
one know what the Politburo
think. Not even the Politburo know
that.”

The chairman had announced
the election of a President for the
coming year and a man in the
back of the room, whom I recognised to be the infamous Livonstak of Belgrade was speaking:
“. and in nominating Gart
Dmitrioff Schwartz I know that in
him we have not only a real Canadian with the college interests at
heart, but also a good party member.”

“IT move nomination cease,’
said Schwartz. “I wish to announce
two popular events; our annua.
banquet on January 12th., and ou
annual Purge on January 11t}
I now wish to discuss our aims
and purposes. (With a leer).
“Two weeks from now Clakoff
will rouse the Residence rabble
and sack the Gym store. Symultaneously Bakeapple will burn
down the flag-pole, and I myself

a

will massacre the worst reaction-'

ary group on the Campus: the
Capitalist Committee on Studies
and Attendance. ”

Loud cheers rang out, and
someone shouted: “What about
the right-wing Gazette?”

“On November 29th., “Schwartz
answered. ‘“‘When everyone is at
the Gazette Gambol, we will have
a Putsch.at the front door and a
Coup d’etat at the back door, and
seize the press-room, whence we

‘THE DALHOUSIE GAZETTE

can issue our own paper, the Red
Blood. Meeting adjourned.”

The meeting broke up, and I
beetled off, knowing that I would
be followed. In the Men’s Residence I shaved ofi my beard, and
reversed my raincoat. Thus escaping notice I fled to the Gazette
office, where I lay low for three
days and tried to sell my story to
the Editors. Big Hans Herz was
to busy with Bigger and Better
Layouts, and I then approached
one Jackson of the Comic Strips,
but he was worried about some
kind of breakfast food. In despair
I went to Dumb Herod, Sports

THE EXILE

Next day he returned to Coimbra, with his friend’s mad scheme
still in his mind. It wasn’t the
madness of youth; Wanowski,
who had played the violin in the
Warsaw Philharmonic orchestra
was at least fifty, and so were
some of the others. The more he
thought of the venture, the more
he liked it.

The venerable
Coimbra must have been
astonished when their new
turer suddenly resigned. Gerstein gave family reasons, but
there were rumors, and he had a
sneaking suspicion that the old
man had guessed his purpose.
There was an odd expression in
his voice when he wished Gerstein
luck with his family affairs, and
shook hands with him.

When he reached Lisbon, he
went to the little hotel where the
others were, and offered to join
them. They seemed pleased, and
had quite a little celebration.
Their vessel was supposed to be
coming up from Setubal in a few
days. Ostensibly they would be
going out fishing, and would not
take much with them. They expected to make the northern
coast of Palestine in three days.

They waited for two weeks until the boat finally arrived. He
remembered that period too well.
The hunger, the lack of money,
the anxiety and the waiting, day
after day, for the boat. The journey itself seemed rather  insignificant, even when Kahn fell
asleep at the rudder, and they
went far off their course. Four
days later they hove in sight of
the coast, and found a British
gunboat waiting for them, They
were too tired and hungry to resist or run, and they were taken
ashore and put in guarded camps,
where they found others who had
tried the same thing.

Then Cyprus... he sighed and
kicked another stone down the
hill, Standing up he looked across
the water to where he thought
Palestine should be. He had read
both the Old and New Testaments
and remembered the Revelation.
' “And IT saw a new heaven and
a new earth: for the first heaven
and the first earth had passed
away; and there was no more sea.
And I John saw the holy city, new
Jerusalem, coming down from
God out of heaven. .. ”

“Tt is done. I am Alpha and
Omega, the beginning and the
end. I will give unto him that is
athirst of the fountain of the
water of life freely . .. I will be
bis! God... .??

A bugle blew somewhere, and
he got up, turned and walked
down the hill.

Third Possibility

The Cooperative Economy, in
spirit, is in sharp contrast to the
existing attitude. Competitive
capitalism encourages selfishnéss,
fear and conflict. The cooperative,
in theory at least, stands for
communal interest, confidence,
and amity.

A cooperative society depends
on the voluntary pooling of Land,
Capital, and Labor. It thus works
on a limited company basis, but
with the vital difference that each
member, no matter what his interest, has but one vote.

In agriculture, cooperative
credit, marketing, buying, use of
machinery, stock sires, and the
like have proved of value to the
uepressed producers of this province. Community labor projects
are less developed.

The Fisheries seem even more
suitable for united endeavour.
For fishing requires ships and
expensive tackle beyond the
reach of ordinary individuals.
Moreover the crew of a ship must
act as an organic whole it must
cooperate. Similar factors apply
to processing fish.

In theory, nothing prevents the
application of cooperation to
forestry. In fact little effort has

 

THE GRAVE DIGGER

“Ah, work is scarce, and I will take
Whatever I can get;

At diggin’ graves, then, I will make
Enough to feed me yet.”

Unto the gloomy churchyard now
He goes and digs a grave.

“I’ve picked me right hard work, I vow—
I am to Death a slave!’

Now home he comes, receives his fee,
For which he worked full well.

“Come now, my love, we’ll married be;
Church-warden, ring the bell.”

That night, while at a public house,
A-drinking to his bride,

Heard a word against his spouse
And fists were laid to hide.

“They’re bringin’ out the corp so grave,
Was killed the night before.”

“Who put they in that new dug grave?”
“Why, him that digged it, sure!”

been made to date.
It is in Mining and Manufac-~

‘turing that the cooperative meets

its big difficulties. Because of
the technical and business. skills
involved, the body of common
members must go beyond its own
ranks to hire managers, engineers,
salesmen, solicitors, and accountants. Again, the numbers involv
ed in modern production makes.

the democratic procedure of the
cooperative unwieldy.

Benefits to be expected are
the wider distribution of wealth
and the assurance of mutual aid
in time of adversity. Cooperation
is the dynamic application of the
insurance principle,

Labor-management cooperation
on price and wage policy boards
is a special feature which may
supercede class conflict. But that
depends on good will, as does all
cooperation.

The great danger of the cooperative movement lies in the
tendency to create a mature corporate society by legislative force.
This replaces organic growth by
a political formula: that is, voluntary association gives way to
regimentation.

~<A BREAK SILENCE

 

 

- After maintaining an undignified silence for a period of three
weeks, the cave dwellers down in the Forrest building have at last
come through with some chatter and bright notes.

aad Notes

Too long have you students of
Dalhousie read of the exploits of
the Engineers alone in the pages
of this journal. Now comes the
time when ye shall harken to the
news from the Forrest building,

. . . the legal luminaries of the
Law School.

For the past few weeks, the
attentions of all down here have
been directed to the proceedings
This, for

formed laymen, is the short name
of the Supreme Moot Court of
Dalhousie, the sedate deliberations of which have been carried
on under your very noses in the
musty confines of the Law School.
This authoritative tribunal discusses and decides matters of
law that have passed under the
gazes of such inferior judical
bodies as the Nova Scotia Su
preme Court and the House of
Lords.

The decisions of their Lordships on the bench of the’ Supreme Moot. Court of Dalhousie
are of course final, and many
have been the words of wisdom,
and loud and long has been the
oratory. expounded before the
learned Law Lords.

It is by reason of the above
labours that-you have been uninformed of the activities of we
legal lads, but from now on you’ll
hear plenty.

 

of the ‘old college try’ to this
campus by trouncing Navy on

Saturday past. Mr. Shepperd, you

gave this old gaffer a new lease
on life. The team, replete with
new jerseys, was all that any fan
could desire, and in passing we
would like to bring into the spotlight one Kerry Dunphy, a sometime star in Canadian Rugby,
who, despite his lack of knowledge of the English game has
turned in a sterling performance
as fullback with the Tigers,

While on the subject of football, or rugger, we would like to
report that even on a clear day
we can only take a ‘dim view’ of
the boots which are supplied to
inter-fac rugby players. This is
the only school in the world that
has rugby boots with cleats on
the inside. Maybe its ‘Stragedy’.
Anyway there are several instances of players having cui
their feet on the nails which stick
up through these ancient boots.

Its high time that someone in
an executive position took a
‘firm stand’ on the Gym Store
situation. Dammit, its too small.
The writer would like to see some
strong action taken in the matter

of a new location for this campus

eatery. It is obvious that the
present store is totally inadequate
in the matter of catering to some
1600 students,

In closing we would like it to
be known that to-morrow afternoon at Wanderer’s grounds the
ferocious Tigers will clash with
the highly rated Wanderers. We
will be forced to take a 5 Star
‘dim view’ of the whole student
body if there are not one thousand loyal Dalhousians at the
game. Your team deserves it.

First and foremost in Co-Ed
news this week is the very successful Delta Gamma meeting
which was held last Wednesday
evening at Shirreff Hall. President Kaye McLean conducted the
meeting. Minutes of the last
meeting were read by Pauline Allsop in the absence of the Secretary-Treasurer, Elsie Cruikshank.

‘Elections were held for the two

remaining positions on the ex
ecutive. Dot Muir was elected
Junior representative, and Pat

McKinnon was elected Sophomore
representative,

Great enthusiasm was shown
toward debating, dramatiecs, and
especially work for the Co-Ed
Week. This latter idea has really
gone over with a bang. This
should and definitely will mean
an exciting week. Last year a
good time was had by all and
this year’s Co-Ed Week looks
even more promising. Following

us all with a greater respect for
that organization housed in the

tiny office off the gymnasium
stage. As Captain Connolly asserted, it is not in the buildings
that we find Dalhousie University,
it is rather in the spirit which we
impart to new students as they

enter the door to higher educa
tion, |
Captain Connolly’s is indeed a

great dream—that of a faculty
- of drama such as has never be
fore existed in our country. He
stressed the fact that a school of
drama must be within the department of English, as the two
fields are inséparable: Not only
would the theory of acting be
taught, but also the mechanics of
motion pictures, of radio, and of
All aspects of the
theatrical field would be treated;
and an outstanding feature would

be a radio station contained with
in the campus; a non-commercial
unit which would provide extension courses for those without
the advantages of obtaining. a
university education.

In Captain Connolly’s words:
“The only things amounting to
anything that ever happens are,
in the beginning, “shots in the
dark”: that is to say, the result

 

‘ THE DALHOUSIE GAZETTE

of a dream; and the trouble with
the dreamers is that they are the
only ones who see the dawn... .
they are the visionaries.

“T believe that the time is not
far distant when Dalhousie will
realize the idea of having a chair
of dramatic are; because the
whole history of Dalhousie University proves that it is more
steeped in culture than any other
institution of its kind in Canada.
I hope that in this year. . . really
the first year of peace. . . the
Dalhousie Glee Club will have
every success in its productions,
and I see no reason whatever why
it should not strike out into
better and more creative work
than has ever been done before.

“T have never met a student
who, having taken part in Glee
Club activities, was not as a result better equipped to take his
place in the world, and particularly in those professions where poise
quick thinking, and clear diction
are necessary.”

Inspiring words, from a man
who is an example of visionary
thinking combined with a genius
in what makes for good show
business—they are a challenge to
all of us who are interested in the
birth of the theatre in Canada,
here on our own campus.

It is an appaling spectacle to
see a supposedly cultivated human
mind wasting the precious time
which remains by drivelling of
the moral degeneration of ‘our

political events must be limited
to the past two years, for the
“recent” lack of morality among
the nations which so dismays him
has been quite evident from the
dawn of history.

War and all its attendant
miseries are the results of a code

hand upper corner of the net
with a beautiful shot.

Dal wound up their seoring a
few minutes later, as Joyce Hart
scored on a pass from Nancy
Jones, who set up the play. Dal
then got two bad breaks in a row,
as Joan Myrden broke her stick
and Sally Flett scored on a pass
from Janet Morrow, to make the
final score 4-1 for Dal.

Actually the game was really
a good one, despite from this
writeup, and the Dal girls deserve full credit for their win.

Saturday’s victory of 4-1, things
look very hopeful for the _ TiegTesses,

arranged by manager Pam Stevens. Watch for notices of the

dorsed the

unanimously enCitizens’ Forum
which it and the Institute of
Public Affairs  sponsers. The
Dalhousie group holds regular
meetings on Tuesday nights.

A request by Les Paige for a
new speaker in the gym to replace the smaller ones, was deferred until an expert could pass
judgment on it. The Pharmacy
students at Dalhousie expressed
their intention of forming a society and requested permission
to have a representative on the
council. This matter was deferred until more information is
available on the status of Pharmacy students at Dal. Several
routine matters concerning the
D.G.A.C. were brought before
the council and were passed
without much discussion.

It was decided after some
consideration, to fine in absentia

CAPITALISM

current crises; to achieve a just
and equitable distribution of the
wealth produced or to maintain
full employment and full pro~
duction.”

“As modern society has grown
the state has been changing, Socialism is the next step in social
evolution and is a common-sense
proposition.”

“Regimentation—the kind of
objection most often raised to.
socialism—has little meaning.
Is it better to have regimenta~
tion to give social benefits or to
have the miserable and evil regimentation of the dollar?”

“The problem of bureaucracy
is that it is a function not of
socialism, but of modern society.
Modern methods of production
are so complex that bureaucracy
is a necessary part of every or~
ganization today. We cannot
have an increase in family allowances, housing, old age pensions, etc., without an increase
in the civil service of the country.
