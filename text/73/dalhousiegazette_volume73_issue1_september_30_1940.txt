of the war, however, the attendance
is only down three from last year,

<l Tigers a
In League

Dalhousie Tigers will contest the
City League this year in company
with Truro, Aldershot, Navy, Acadia
and Wanderers, according to a decision reached at a meeting of the
league in the Gymnasium last Friday. At the same meeting Henry
Ross was elected president of the
body for the coming year. Reg Hart
and Jim Arnott filled the posts of
vice-president and secretary-treas.

Chief topic of discussion at the
gathering was the ruling of President Carleton Stanley that Dalhousie
couldcould not meet Acadia on the
football field. The reason for this

‘ruling was that the university had

subscribed to a resolution banning
intercollegiate sports for the duration of the war.

Mr. Ross reported that he had contacted President to point out that
the City League did not exist for intercollegiate competition. Both the
President and the head of the Board
of Governors, J. McG. Stewart, were
firm in their views, however, that
Dal should not play against any
college.

Truro came into the senior league
after it was decided that intermediate competition would be impossible
this year. It was suggested, however, that Dal Cubs and an intermediate squad from the Navy and any
others could play exhibition tilts. |

Fred Kelley said that Acadia could,
play only on Saturday, due to the
military training program being carried out there. )

The difficulty is to be overcome by
means of an interlocking schedule
over six weeks in ‘which Dal and
Acadia do not meet. League stand

SPORTS ACTIVITIES

First indications of this year’s sport were very discouraging to those who wish to see an active and vigorous program in all fields. Present indications are, however, that in
spite of no intercollegiate games and limited time and space
for practice, there will be activity in most fields this year.

being paid to military training will |
have its repercussions in the sports
