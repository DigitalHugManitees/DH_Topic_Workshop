Delta Gamma at War
The Delta Gamma Society, since it consists of all girls

jects in connection with Canada’s War Effort, and the society

has not fallen short of this expectation.

The Delta Gamma

girls have entered into the war work wholeheartedly, and have

s: cooperated on all occasions when their help was needed. Many

on this campus do not realize the extent of this work being

THE HISTORY OF
DELTA GAMMA

Delta Gamma is the organization which sponsors all the|
activities of women students of Dalhousie University. To the
class of 1900 belongs the honour of founding this famous institution. It had for its first president Miss E. A. MacLeod,
the first secretary was Miss Grace Burris, and the first meeting took place at the home of Miss Jean Forrest.

Delta Gamma was originally a debating society. At one
of its first meetings, on November 30th, 1900, the debate of
the evening was “Resolved that women should not enter the
higher professions.” It is interesting to note that the resolu
| tion was defeated.

In the calendar of 1911 the Delta Gamma Club is described
as “a literary society which holds bi-monthly meetings. All
_lady students are eligible.” In the account of this Society in
the Dalhousie Gazette of 1911, we are told its aim was two-fold.

have changed a great deal. Gone are the debates of each
meeting. However, there is still a debating team under a
capable manager, and each year several debates are held with
eirls from sister universities. In 1939 in conjunction with
debating, Delta Gamma decided to sponsor an Effective Spesking Club.

Another one of Delta Gamma’s many activities is dramatics. Tach year it is the custom of this Society to present
a play in competition for the Connolly Shield. The actors in
such plays have succeeded in bringing victory to Delta Gamma.

The Dalhousie Girls’ Athletic Club is responsible to this
organization. It is this club which supervises girls’ ground
hockey, basketball, badminton, ping pong and tennis.

At Delta Gamma’s first meeting after war was declared
‘in 1939, the Honorary President, Miss MackKeen, spoke to the
girls about the organization of a St. John Ambulance First

The discussion following the broadcast was one of the liveliest in weeks
and it was at once evident that the
main point of controversey was
whether Canada was to take one of
three courses in the post-war world.
(1) Tie herself closer to Great Britain and the rest of the Commonwealth such was suggested by
Lord Halifax in his recent and muchpublicised speech. (2) Seek closer
economic and political ties with the

The Snow Goose
By PAUL GALLICO
Publisher: Alfred A. Knopf—$1.35

Have you ever heard the legend
of the Snow Goose, that strange,
mysterious bird that hovered over
Dunkirk and a queer, mishapen
figure in a little boat? To whom
did this figure belong, and was the
great white bird that fiew against
the sky merely 4 vision? Paul Gallico reveals the mystery and identity
of both man and bird, in a haunting
tale which begins on a solitary
marsh along the Essex coast of
England. There, in an abandoned
lighthouse at the mouth of the River
Alder, lived Philip Rhayader, driven
into seclusion by his warped and
grotesque body, but never quite alone
because of the bird sanctuary he had
made for himself, where many hundreds of birds gathered to be fed or
painted by him. For “tamed in his
enclosures were the geese that came
winging down the coast from Iceland an Spitsbergen each October, in
great skeins that darkened the sky
and filled the air with the rushing
noise of their passage—the brown
bodied. pink feet, white-breasted
barnacles with their dark necks and
clowns’ masks, the wild white fronts
with black barred breasts, and many
species of wild ducks,. widgeon,
mallard, pintails, teal and shovelers.”
These wild but beautiful creatures
remained in the enclosures “from
October to the early spring, when
they migrated north again to ee
breeding grounds below the ice rim.’

Then, there appeared one day the
Saxon girl Fritha, slender,
haired and as “eerily beautiful as a
marsh faery”.
ried a wounded bird which
brought to Rhyader in the hope that)
he might cure it.
one of the immense white pionions

 

Whose

  

      
   
   

sky. Yet it returned once more in
the fall and continued to return
throughout the seasons, its clear,
high notes heralding each black-andwhite pinioned” approach. Every
Season on its return visit Fritha
would come to greet it at the lighthouse and passing swiftly from
childhood to young womanhood came
to love-and learn what lay beyond
the grotesque form of Philip Rhayader.

Soon after the outbreak of war
had shattered a peaceful existence,
Philip set out valiantly to aid in
the rescue of Dunkirk, and high
above him gleamed the pinions of
the Snow Goose which had learned
to follow wherever he went. What
took place at Dunkirk and how the
image of the snow goose managed
to become a legend in the minds of
many men is vividly, graphically,
related and the story moves swiftly
to a brief but tragic conclusion. It
is a short narrative this tale of bird
and marshland, but its simple artistry and skillful moving pathos will
make it memorable to all who
read it.

or any of the others could do with their time if they had the books they
need to study and paper and instruments to work with. Is ther a student

ts|in Dalhousie or any other of our colleges who would not chip in a dollar

Well that is exactly what the LS.
S. (international Student Service)
is for. The I.S.S. operates under the
Geneva Convention of 1929, signed
by all the nations in the world except Japan. It regulates the treatment of prisoners. Under it the
LS.S., through the European Student Relief, operates on both sides
of no-man’s land, and sends textbooks and study material to student
prisoners of war.

Its agent goes from Geneva into
Germany or other enemy country,
visits the prison camps in person,
sees the prisoners of war, finds out
what studies they want to follow
and sees they get the necessary
books. An enemy representative, under the same Convention, visits. the
camps on our side of the line and
does the same, or has the chance to
do the same, for enemy prisoners.
It is reciprocal.

Last year alone no less than 39,000 heoks were thus sent to Allied
prisoners in German and Italian
camps.

The money that does this is raised
among students in the colleges of
the United States and Canada. Last
year the college students in Canada
raised $10,000. There are more prisoners now than last year and there
will be more still. This year the
1.S.S. wants to double this amount
and raise $20,000. Every student
will want to have a hand in work
like this. Every student is asked
to give at least a dollar.

As it works out, the greater effort
is done among the officer class. This
is because under the Convention the
enemy e>nnot force the officers to
work. They therefore have time
hanging on their hands and are able
to use that time to great advantage
if given the chance. This gives them
the chance. Among them are often
capable instructors, so that often
classes are held up ito univgysity
standard.

The universities of Oxford, Cambridge and London even send examination papers and grant degrees. It
is said of British prisoners of war
that more Britons are studying art
subjects in prison camps today than
in British universities.

The monies gathered never leave
Allied hands. Books and study material are shipped via the Red Cross,
and is distributed as. set out above.
There is no enemy interference, for,
should such result, automatically
they deprive themselves of the right
to aid their otvn prisoners of war.

We do not wish to leave the impression that this work applies only
to the officer class. The same work
is done among the rank and file, but,
under the rules of the Convention,
they may have far less time.

This work is-a godsend to our
boys, a glad relief of monotony, supplies a healthy interest, and enables
them to continue their studies and
save long, weary, wasted days. It
may mean the difference between
hope and despair.

out with absolutely nothing to do.
What a difference if you had your
books and could get down to brass
tacks and master your work, as you
never mastered it before and could
look forward to coming home with
intensive study behind you, ready
to step into your place as if you had
been at college.

Surely there is not a boy or girl
on the campus at Dalhousie who
would not want to have a part in
this work, These lads did their bit.
They were not killed. They are prisoners in a foreign land. And a dollar from you will brighten their life,
give them a continuing interest, and
save them from weariness, monotony
and dejection. It will give them a
chance beyond anything they hoped,
preserve their mental health and
prepare them for their real work in
life.

An opportunity will be provided
by which each student can make his
contribution to the I.8.S. This is
writen that you may know what it
is all about and be ready when our
quota is called for.

DRAMATICS

Rehearsals are well under way for
the three-act play, “Return Engagement”, by Lawrence Riley, directed
by Mrs. Karl Clark. The well-chosen
cast consists of Elaine ‘Hopewell,
Katherine Woodhouse, Jean Nicol,
Enid Arnoff, Betty Atkins, Joyce
Hart, Eileen Phinney, Arthur Hartling, Peter Donkin, Jim Bell, Donald,
Harris, Charles O’Connell, Bill Ogilvie, and Car] Dexter.

This principle Glee Club production will be presented to the students
and the public on March 3rd and
March 5th in the Dal Gym. As a
special concession to all those working hard to make “Return Engagement” a success, we ask the patrons
to be in their seats well before curtain time, and warn that the doors
will be closed when the curtain rises,
until the end of the first act.

The play is being produced under
the watchful eye of Barbara White,
Glee Club President, ably assisted by
other members of Glee Club staff.
This play gives promise of a mar- |
velous evening’s entertainment, and
everybody is urged to attend. Tell
your friends, students, and aim for a
record attendance.

In Akron, the Rev. Dallas F. Bilington, deprived of his driving

cannot be blamed this time on the

basketball teams to Mount A. Regardless of number, all present “got

of Jerry’s 9-piece orchestra. Chaperones were Prof. and Mrs. Bennett,

due the Dance Committee: Dave

The first Dalhousie Radio Debate
in a number of years got off to a
bad start when a blizard and U.N.B.
hit Halifax at the same time. The
debate, scheduled for 10  o’clock,
Wednesday was not able to be broadcast due to the lack of power at
CHNS. However, a transcription is
being made, and as soon as time and
conditions are favorable, Bob MeCleave and Jim MacLaren on Dal,
and Ralph Crewther and Fred David-son of U.N.B. will take to the air.
We wish both teams the best of luck, .
and may the best man win!

naa 3 Peceridng and versatile Susan

ay better known to her wide
circle of friends as Suze, who is this
year completing her senior year in
the faculty. of Arts.

-Suzd brings to us a bit of Paradiag, both figuratively and literally
for she comes from Paradise, Nova
Scotia. She entered Edgehill when
eleven years of age where she spent
the next five years completing her
senior matriculation in 1911. At
Edgehill Suze was very active in
sports, including basketball and
ground hockey, also proving to be an
accomplished pianist. A prefect her
last yéar Suze entered Dal in 1941
on a Regional Scholarship:

Soon after Suze became a Dal
co-ed, she tried her hand at sports,
taking her ‘place on the Junior
Basketball and Ground Hockey
teams, and also proving to be a first
hand reporter for the Dalhousie
Gazette. Taking an active part in
the Glee Club, Suze in her freshette

_year helped with the costumes and

took part in the Frosh show, later
playing a minor lead in the threeact play, “Big-Hearted Herbert’.
Finishing off her first year with
gloty, Suze was named as the
“Sweater Queen’’the first and last to
wear the crown.

1942-43 brings Suze to her junior
year in which she easily kept up her
high scholastic record along with
many social activities. In the fall of
this year Suze became Vice-President and Treasurer of Pi Beta Phi
and took part in the fraternity play,
also becoming an invaluable member
of Midlothian and La Cercle Francais.

Suze, still not having her quota of
work, suceessfully held the positions
of Secretary Treasurer of Delta
Gamma and D.G.A.C., Arts and
science Representative for the Student Couneil, active member of the
Red Cross Dance Committee, the
Munro Day Committee, the Student
Gym Committee, the Delta Gamma
Forces Dance and the Sadie Hawkins Executive. With all this. Suze
‘still found time to participate in
Ground Hockey, again making the
team.

In her graduating year Suze has
reached the culmination of her collegiate careet,—the efficient president
of Delta Gamma and of’ Shirreff
Hall. Besides these positions Suze

Is social chairman of Midlothian,

Professor Bennect’s librarian for
English 5; she is the organizer of
the campus W.V.S., a member of
the Blood Donor Executive, Suze has
given her blood once and plans to
donate it a second time. Again
taking a hand in Dramaties she has
played a major lead in the Pi Beta
Phi one-act play.

As a final tribute Suze has been

‘Named as an outstanding personality

in Arts and Science, and given the

honour of becoming Life Secretary
“of the Class of ’44. On Munro Day

Suze will-be awarded an Honorary
Student Council “D” which she deserves in every right. Congratulations and good luck, Suze, may the
success you have attained here be

if ‘reached again in all future en_deavours.
