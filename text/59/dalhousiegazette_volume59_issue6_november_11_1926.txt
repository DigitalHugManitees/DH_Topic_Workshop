_ To Editor, the Dal. Gaszetie.
__- | have read with a great deal of pleasure
editorial, in last week's issue of the

— hours during which the Macdonald
Library is kept open to ‘‘thirsty”’ Dal
- housians. Let us hope that the faculty
_ will soon wake up to the fact that we
desire access to the books that have
been provided for us by people who
' meant them to be read, not hidden away.
__._ As you may remember, I circulated a
ee ee last year asking that the library
_____ be kept open one hour longer: from five
to six. This petition was signed by
nearly + twohundred interested students.
___-_-‘The request was granted. It was at
once obvious that the hour between
____ five and six was by far the most popular
from the point of view of attendance,
_ therefore I felt confident that the extra

Break Track Records

 

Dalhousie’s track team broke no less
than four records at the Dartmouth indoor meets this year. Miller, who has
won every race he ran in this year, broke
the record for the 50 yards, doing it in
a fifth less than the former record. He
also broke the 220 record, cutting it down
a fifth also.

Miller, Matheson, MacDonald and
Keating ran in a relay team, breaking the
former record at the first of the two
meetings. At the second meet, the team
broke their own former record by four
seconds, in one of the most thrilling
races ever seen in Eastern Canada. In
this event Keating and Matheson, the
two first runners, maintained a position
almost neck and neck with the leading
opposition; in the third lap, MacDonald
unfortunately fell but recovered in time
to hand Miller the stick while there was
still a slim fighting chance to win. Miller
closed in on his man in his first half and
then passed him for a decisive win.

In the half mile event, Dalhousie
figured in the lime-light; Ed Brown
taking second place on the first night and
H. Dowell taking the same position at the
second meet.

. N announcement of much _ interest
*% to Dalhousians was made last Wed
the team to debate Cambridge was made
There have been many _ predictions as to who would have the honor
of representing the University, but the
students should now be satisfied, for
their fortunes are in the hands of a strong
and well-balanced team.

Mr. Walter Darby is well known to the
student-body, having served for a term
as President of Sodales, and having
represented Dalhousie in two _ intercolleziate debates. He first came to the
front in 1924, when he led the University
team against Kings. In this debate his
good qualities were recognized, for the
next year he was chosen to lead Dal
against U. N. B. Last year he was
placed on the Dal team chosen to face
the Imperial team, but unfortunately he
was seriously injured in a train wreck
while returning from his Christmas
holidays. This year he is again chosen
as leader of the team. Darby is a quiet,
rather easy speaker, who seldom calls
upon oratory to convince his_ judges.
His speeches sometimes lack fire, but
they are witty and always logical and
full of sound arguments. He is especially
effective in rebuttal, through his ability
to think quickly and yet logically.

Mr. Sterling Brown, who is now
in his fourth year in the University, has
through his whole course been a consistent supporter of Sodales. A regular
attendant at all debates, and a determined
contestant in the trials through a number
of years, he won recognition last year
when he was chosen to lead the team
against Mount Allison. In that encounter
he gave a very good account of himself
and this year is on the executive of
Sodales and has been given the crowning
honor of a place on the Cambridge team.
While he is not in any way an extraordinary
speaker, in “all branches of debating he
is uniformly good. ‘To one who is searching for faults Brown offers a very poor
field, for he is equally good in argument,
language and presentation.

Mr. Roderick H. MacLeod began his
debating career in Pictou Academy,
when he supported the negative of the
resolution,—‘‘Resolved that the world
is getting better.’ From then until
now his career bas been one continuous
story of successes. Like Mr. Brown, a
consistent supporter of Sodales, his
merits were recognized last year when he
debated against Mount Allison and
worthily represented Dal. Mr. MacLeod
is the orator of the team and his polished
style will serve him well in the contest
with the Cambridge men. He is not
lacking in argument or logic and will do
honor to Dal in the forthcoming debate.

out of there last summer and I can
quite believe them. Edgehill lined up
a youthful but speedy team and_ an
efficient army of line judges. The
whistle blew and they were away banging
and smashing the ball and each others toes
and shins. The Dal maidens had since

Game Featured By Penalties

MacLeod and Smith
Play Good Game

HE Red and Blue of Acadia met the

Gold and Black of Dalhousie on
Studley Campus, November 4th, in the
second meeting between these two teams
this year. At last reports, the ‘Blue’
was predominant in Acadia College
circles for the Tigers stepped over the
invaders tothe tune of 11—3—a penalty
kick, two touchdowns and a convert
accounting for Dalhousie’s scores and a
lone penalty kick by Davison bringing
the three counts for Acadia.

It was a fine run by Ernst culminating
in a pass to Kelly Maclean who crashed
through a heap of Acadians, that obtained
the first score. Ab Smith converted with
a terrific boot from a moderately difficult
angle. This score seemed to arouse the
Acadians and it was a give and take,
ding-dong battle for the rest of the first
period. Play swayed back and forth
with several threats by both sides but the
gods were not propitious and the period
ended 5—0.

Play had been resumed but a short
time when it was seen that the rest
between periods had done the Tigers
good. Fine runs by the half-liners were
rewarded when Bunker crashed over the
line for a touchdown. However, the
angle was too difficult to allow of any
converting and the kick fell short. Just
to show the Tigers that they couldn't
have everything their own way Davison
inserted a penalty kick. Penalty kicks
were numerous in this period, ‘Jim’
MacDonald having a keen eye for
over-eager youths who spent too much
time in enemy territory. One of the
Acadians had the misfortune to commit
this little mistake in front of the Acadian
goal posts. Plam! and Ab notched up
three more points for the Tigers.
11—3 and that 6—5 game at Acadia

ollege grounds was well avenged! No
further score resulted and the game
ended with everybody but the Acadians
satisfied.

For the Tigers everybody worked well.
MacLeod, the new full-back, improved
wonderfully on his play at that difficult
position. The half liners worked well
and were wonderfully assisted by the
quarters and forwards. Ab Smith did all
the kicking and did it well. Tupper as
usual featured with some fine following
up.
A feature of the game was the courtesies extended by each set of rooters to
the other. After a few experiences with
the Wanderers’ fans, the change was
more than delightful.

Jim MacDonald performed in his usual
efficient manner; and there is no higher
praise for Jim certainly is a splendid
referee.

The lineup:

Dalhousie—Forwards, MacLean, Beaton, Cox, Tupper, Baxter, Ernst, A.
Smith. Quarters, Dobson, Wickwire,
Hewat. Halves, Murphy, ‘‘Doc’’ Smith,
Brown, A. MacDonald, A. Sutherland.
Fullback, MacLeod.

YANK COLLEGE ORDERS
JOCK’S BOOK

The growing evidence of the favor with
which Dalhousie and her products is
regarded by other great colleges has
received a further impetus by the ordering
of fifty copies of Dr. John Cameron's
“Regional Anatomy’’ by firms which
supply the Harvard Medical School.
Though in no sense the official textbook,
Dr. Cameron’s work has been a favorite
among Harvard Medicals for some years.
The order exhausted the first edition
of the book and a second edition is now
on the press with orders from colleges in
Upper Canada still unfilled.

The Play’s The Thing

 

HAT would you think? A couple of hundred students are in
a moving picture theatre. There is a continual uproar: while
the drama goes forward silently, practically every student

calls out directions to the players. An actor puts on his hat and

coat—one hundred voices protest: ‘What did you do that for?’ ‘Why
didn’t you put on the right sleeve first?’ ‘Where did you learn to
put on a hat?’ ‘What do you think a hat’s for?’ The actor does
not hear. Another actor, when he might have turned to the right,
turns fo the left—a howl of applause and a yell of disappointment
go up simultaneously. The actor goes his way unheeding. A player
takes out a cigarette case—‘Pass it! Pass it!’ cry hundreds of students. The player does not notice. The hero inadvertently bumps
into and knocks down a passer-by. ‘‘Dirty Passer-by!’ calls the
mob, ‘Jump on him Hero!’ The hero hears not.

The din and tumult is unceasing—the next day there will be
hundreds of sore throats; for the rest of that day every mind will
be muddled from the noise and excitement; perhaps the shouting
will counteract and destroy the results of many quiet hours. Scattered

here and there throughout the crowd are a few who do not coach the

players; they try vainly to enjoy the entertainment. Some of them
give up the attempt and turn to a study of their companions; they
shake their heads. From among the crowd come leaders, whom the
students have chosen to lead in organized applause, and stand out
in the front of the theatre. Every student, including through a

feeling of loyalty those whom the heckling and crabbing has dis_ gusted, joins in the cheers.

The concerted applause, which might
gainst a background of silence, seems of little volume.

Right Persons, Wrong Reasons

 

Students too often elect to the various student jobs the right
persons for the wrong reasons. There is truth, which few see, in the
familiar criticism that students elect officers because of their popularity. Students making this remark—he is a rare student who has
not made it—seem to think that if we took ability as our criterion
we would choose different officers. Nothing could be farther from
the mark. We would elect practically the same students as we do
now: popularity and ability, as a general rule, go together. We elect
the right persons on poor considerations. We must not jump to the
conclusion that it then makes no difference whether we choose student
officers for ability or for popularity. It does; it makes a great deal of
difference. If we choose an officer for ability he will show ability;
if we choose the same man because he is popular he will naturally
endeavour in his job to be popular. In fact it is almost impossible
for a person in any responsible position to do anything unless he has
supporters who want him to doit. In electing a man because you like
him when you might elect him because you think him capable—when
you might expect something from him—you make it impossible for
him to do himself justice!

So it is with the Council of the Students. We do not consider,
when we vote for a man, his opinions, his beliefs, of his talents; we do
not ask him to say even that he will do his best. Just consider what
would happen to the state if national politics went on in that fashion! A
little while ago the question came up in the Council whether or not the
football team might go to Charlottetown for Thanksgiving—involving
an expense of a couple of hundred dollars. We know little about the
merits of the question, nor are we concerned now. No one will question
that any one might have come honestly to the conclusion that either
side was right. The anti-trip side was the unpopular one; a student
who did not believe the trip to be wise had to stand up and say to the
fifteen college heroes, No, you cannot have your excursion. To vote
against it he had to have more than an average amount of character.
That was the situation. We students created it. If we were not
satisfied with the outcome we may blame ourselves. When the
Council elections come again, will we remember this?

ARTHUR MURPHY REPLIES TO
ALBERTA’S FIRST SPEECH

 

HE inspiration of environment which

the radio performer so misses 1s also
lacking as I strike my typewriter keys.
It is true, I do not tremble nor must I
selfconsciously reach for the water pitcher
to win a moment’s reprieve. But there
are other things. I cannot scan your
faces to learn if I bore you. I cannot
storm about nor smite the table with a
thundering fist. You could not heed me.
It really must be dull for you, much as if,
being students, you could not see the
professor as he spoke. All lectures would
be tedious even aS many now are tedious.
Means would constantly be sought for
evading them. Foolish thought. They
would be fruitless. There is the compulsory attendance rule. oe

Our facetious humorist of the prairie
land has disregarded the maxim of
saying nothing when you have nothing to
say. We, at Dalhousie, have been
seriously considering compulsory attendance since the days when Alberta was
synonymous with a Hudson Bay outpost.

You will remember the story of David
and his giant foe. The mighty Goliath
was slain with a mere pebble and a leather
thong, Such a simple thing. Now you
cannot wonder when I tell you that one
equally simple shows the iniquity of the
compulsory attendance regulation. I
shall tell you many times; the last words
I write shall be of it, because you must
realize the greatness of its simplicity.
It is this—

The average university student 1s a man.

The age of the average Dalhousie
student, as verified by the Registrar, is
well over twenty-one years. It may be
objected that Dalhousie is but one university of many. That it need not be typical.
This we grant; nay, even more, we endorse
it. Dalhousie is not typical.

I shall tell you why.

Dalhousie is located in a city. As a
result 40% of its students are from the
city. It is undisputed that city students,
owing to better educational facilities, are
more advanced for their years. This
tends to make the Dalhousie student
younger. Again, the professional enrolment at Dalhousie is relatively small
being only 203 out of 744. As the nonprofessional students are considerably
the younger, the Dalhousie age is still
further lowered when compared with
universities such as McGill or Queens.
Thus is it seen that with a few possible
exceptions the age of the average student
is yet greater at other universities. And
the average student is representative.

Before the whole world the student is a
man. Yet his university treats him as
if he were still to attain the age of reason.
A few universities grant the privilege of
free will. Oxford, Cambridge, Princeton
would consider a ruling such as ours an
affliction. The great authority of these
universities may not be ignored.

The ‘‘few’’ universities cultivate the
student’s manhood. The student responds. The remainder use a_ whip

called compulsory attendance and again
he responds—as does a horse in harness.

Being human his interest is curbed by
obligation.

He cannot diverge enough from the
beaten track to give his individuality
play.

His initiative is destroyed.

Above all, that self-reliance, anatomically known as backbone, which is the very
core of manhood, instead of being nurtured
and developed to the utmost, is macerated
and weakened by the whip and lash.

In the elementary school, as a boy, the
student’s primary habits are forming and
he is taught to use his mind. In the
university, as a man he should be taught
to live and the great teacher is Experience.

Some one once spoke sagely on forcing
a horse to drink. He might have added
that if the horse be really thirsty he will
seek out water for himself. Despite
my simile of the whip, I do not liken the
student to a horse. A horse has four

legs. Only an absent-minded professor
or a university senate would overlook
that. Yet all living beings have some
things in common. The student will
work only if he has the desire, the amhition to do things. He may be persuaded,
even intrigued, but he cannot be forced.
Sometime you have little to do, try
pushing a balky horse. If you survive,
hold a sugar lump before his nose. There
is a difference.

Force has never been found successful
in dealing with any type of psychological
complex. The indifferent student, under
his own impetus, would probably discover
his futility in the first year of college life.
Instead of this he is pushed on for two or
three years, in constant friction with the
university authorities, and finally drops
out, little better than before, a great
loser both in time and in money. The
university has not been fair to him; she
has not been fair to herself.

For the ambitious student the regulation is a lamentable handicap, restraining all those attributes which he wished
most to develop. Should the man whose
life is of the greater value to the world
be sacrificed in a futile endeavor to goad
on his spiritless confrere?

Yet, this, in practice, is the result of
the compulsory attendance regulation,
disguised as it is in a cloak of impartiality
and democracy.

Since we have taken the liberty of
thus classifying our student we shall now
look upon him from a more material
aspect. Speaking broadly, he must be
either an Arts or a professional student.
You will be told that the professional
student is better able to care for himself,
having a definite goal in view and being
of more mature years; that it is the Arts
student who needs most the guiding
hand (holding the whip).

I shall show you that the Arts student
has the greater need of freedom.

The professional student is learning a
definite trade which he hopes to capitalize
in later years. But the Arts man does
not take a Bachelor's degree for what he
hopes to learn of Latin or Chemistry or
what you will. He is simply building
a foundation for himself. He is learning
to live. The university is his world in
laboratory form and it must be a replica
of the main street of life. There are no
guiding hands, no petty restrictions on
main street, no definite rules for success.
And so the Arts school, in placing the
student in an unnatural atmosphere, is
failing in its purpose to teach bim of the
world beyond.

There is an old story of a whole battle
which was lost for the want of a horseshoe
nail. And similarly we may trace all
great disasters to little things. In the
vastness of the world the compulsory
attendance regulation is of trifling littleness. Yet it is one of those little things,
possibly greater than any of us dream,
that impairs manhood.

Somewhere you have a Bible. Seek it
out and read again the story of David and
Goliath.

Freshmen Only

 

This is just to remind you,
Freshman, that it is barely five
weeks till the exams. Time goes
quickly at college, doesn’t it?
You will find the Dalhousie standard higher than any high school
standard. Many meet disaster
because they do not realize this.
Last Christmas the faculty plucked 90%—or some such huge percentage—of the freshman class.
Forewarned is forearmed.

DIXERIE DOT

 

|THE Gazette is very fortunate in

securing the services of Miss Dixerie
Dot, famous heart specialist. Undergraduates, who wish to avail themselves
of her advice, may do so by addressing
a letter to her and slipping it in one of
the Gazette boxes.

Dear Dixerte Dot:

I am a young man of 20. I have no
bad habits. I am undecided whether to
become Poet Laureate or Prime Minister.
I ought to make a good Poet Laureate,
because Professor MacMechan gave me
an A-+ on my sonnet, while, on the other
hand, when people find out what high
marks I made in Govt. I, they will no
doubt want to make me Premier. |
think that I should rather like to be
Premier because I made the debating
team last year and being Premier would be
rather like that. My parents have often
told me that I am destined to go down in
Histiography.

Now dear Dixerie Dot, please tell me
why, since I am a young man of such
gowing prospects, | am not more popular
with the fair sex. Please give me your
opinion why this is so, as | am very
anxious to rectify it.

Yours truly,

Apollo.

 

Dear Appollo:

It is difficult to understand why a
young man with so many good points
should be so unpopular. You are the
kind of young man who will give a girl
both a good home and social standing—
and what more should a well brought
up girl desire? Furthermore you seem
to be of an aggressive disposition and
therefore ought to appeal to a girl’s most
deep seated instincts.

But whereas the aggressiveness which
comes from an inward consciousness of
power will sweep a girl off her feet,
conceit, which is merely the outward
cloak of inherent deficiency, inspires, and
rightly inspires, almost any girl with
contempt. This, Appollo, is the impediment which mars your success. I would
advise you to read Bruce Barton's
article entitled ‘‘Conceit, God’s Great
Gift to Little Men.” I would further
advise you to acquire what one might
call ‘‘the goods” and then you will not
feel it necessary to appear to be what you
are not.

Sincerely,
Dixerie Dot.

 

Dear Dixerie Dot:

I am very anxious to attend‘‘ Midsummer Night’s Dream’’ in order to
study Miss Glossop-Harris’s articulation
and choice of words, and, like a good
Dalhousian, I should prefer to be there
on November 24. But the last time I
was at the Majestic on a Dal night, I got
a pea in my ear and flour mixed up with
my beard. I am very anxious to go but
I do not wish to have my dignity outraged
by’ the vulgarity of the groundlings.
Please advise me what I should do.

Sincerely,
Chesterfield.

—__—_—_——_

Dear Chesterfield:

You are evidently a freshman or
you would not be asking such a foolish
question. By all means go. You should
be willing to take the bitter with the
sweet. Anyhow, flour and peas are
going to be done away with. The only
thing that you are liable to get is a paper
dart down the back of your neck.

Sincerely,
Dixerie Dot.

When she came back after lunch she
kept debating whether or not to give in,
but decided not to be laughed at by
Mabel. Everything was going along as
usual, until a large, stout, lady came in
and was trying on hats; when she finally
got one that she liked, she asked Ora
how it looked. Ora turned white, gritted
her teeth, then said, “It looks horribly

The lady was so astonished she could
not speak for a few seconds, but when her
voice came back, she called the ‘‘Boss’’,
and told him what Ora bad said. At
first he didn’t know what to think or say;
then he apologized to the lady, told Ora
to call for her pay and said, ‘‘You’re
fired!”

‘IT am not,’’ snapped Ora, ‘‘I quit!”’

She got her pay, went to her room, and
started to cry; Mabel came in about
half an hour later, and she was still
crying. Mabel laughed; Ora looked at
her in astonishment, and started to tell
her what had happened, but Mabel
said: ‘“‘Never mind telling me, I know,—

later she disappeared, going under stern

se their first theme was announced to the
members of English II. As far as one
i ae could judge from the Nigger Heaven of
‘the Chemistry Theatre it ran as follows:
Reading English for a Degree.” That
title implied that a student must read
English for a degree. Now I for one had
always had the erroneous impression that
one reads English for enjoyment, or at

—for improvement. I had never for a

that first came to me was one of disappointment, and then, strangely enongh,
the disturbing idea struck me that perhaps there was something in it after all
—that perhaps the professor responsible
for it might know what he was talking
about. ;

A short time ago I read an article by
Mr. Gilbert Norwood, entitled Too

eight hundred odd students at Dalhousie
oes one so corrupted as to think that there
as really are too many books, he should
ead that article—it would cheer bim in

finding out what students were most
interested in their work —even if they
did lose some of them in the process.
Obviously, if this system were introduced:
either all the books would be destroyed
or all the students would be martyred.
I do not wish to stir up sedition, but |
do think that the students should agitate
for such a reform. Of course there is
always the danger that the University
authorities would refuse to sanction it
for fear of losing all the students. But if
that difficulty were once removed, who
knows but that “reading English for a
degree’ might be eliminated from the
college curriculum?

This, as I said, was my first idea. As
I can see now, it was slightly premature.
I have a vague suspicion that Dalhousie
is too old fashioned to allow such radical
changes. However, it was premature for
another reason. Not because the students—that is the sensible students, would
not look forward to having less to read
but because the method I have mentioned would not be practical in bringing about such a desirable end. | mean
that even the most conscientious professor
will admit that his primary reason for
teaching is not to fill his pocket, but to fill
his stomach. Thus, if all our English
books were destroyed the English lecturer, to keep his stomach full, would be
forced to administer the same thing to us
by some other equally efficient method.
We might even be compelled to read some
other language for a degree. Personally,
if | have to read Shakespeare or Milton,
I should much rather read them in
English, than in, say, Eskimo or Hottentot. But since the students really have
no voice in the matter, we may just as well,
I suppose, employ the fatalistic attitude
and try to enjoy what is prescribed for us.

Seriously, though, the intelligent reading of English, leading to a greater
appreciation of our literature, is an
essential side of our studies. If we get
a degree by means of it, so much the
better. If we do not, we have gained
something that will remain with us long
after we have forgotten such trivialities
as the square-root of two and the formula
for dephlogisticated marine acid air.

DALHOUSIE GAZETTE
The Halifax Trip

Episode Two

We left off last week while we were on
our way back to the Carol Shop to find
the girls and try and persuade them to
continue our walk around Halifax. I
think Bud and I will go in after them,
besides, I need a pair of silk socks for
the Law Dance tonight. We are very
sorry to have kept you waiting, but
Keltie had bought something that required wrapping up. Well our next
stop is Farrell’s who is another of our
college stationers and keeps some of that
nice Dal notepaper. Next door is the
MacDonald Music Co., where you can
get anything you want from uke strings to
pianos. Cooley’s next are good reasonable
jewellers and are the people who make
the Literary ‘D's’. Further along is
J. W. O’Neill’s who has some very fine
men's furnishings. Stop a moment, there
is an argument on in the front line, but
before I reach the scene it is all over.
“Come along Bill we can get a milk
shake on the way home’”’ cries Stevie, so
we all amble on past the Green and stop
at the corner of Sackville St., watching
Officer MacLeod directing the long
streams of traffic with an efficient hand.
Let’s stop here and look around, for from
this corner we can see the Royal Print
who are in the Herald and Mail Building.
Tip Top Tailors where you all know $24
buys a suit. Hubley’s where you can
get it pressed and across the street in
Ackers old theatre is the new Frisco.
On the opposite corner is Wallace’s
Shoe store and down the hill Scotty
Shield’s Barber Shop. Opposite Scotty's
is Lee’s, in fact Lee’s is almost under our
feet. ‘‘No Kelly it’s not a Chinese
dive, but a darn good barber shop.”
Down at the foot of the hill a turn to the
right and a walk up stairs is the Suitatorium, who will press and clean anything and call for it too. Oh! well its
rather late so we'll meet here again next
week.

Casino Notes

With Milton Sills, Noah Beery, Petty
Bronson, Katie Price, Charlie Murray
and Lloyd Whitlock all in the cast,
‘‘Paradise’’, which the Casino theatre is
showing this week-end should need no
further recommendation. Here is a cast
of players that must surely make any
type of picture or story interesting and
well worth seeing and from advance
reports the picture is quite as big as its
cast.

Following ‘‘Paradise’’, Rex Beach's
story of Broadway night club life,
“Padlocked”’ will go into the Casino for a
three day run beginning Monday of
next week. Here again another fine
cast of players are brought together
among whom are pretty Lois Moran,
Louise Dresser, Allan Simpson, Douglas
Fairbanks. Jr., and Florence Turner.
No more powerful theme than this up-tothe-minute tale of a girl of to-day has
ever reached the screen and it is said to
be by far the best of the many Rex
Beach stories.
