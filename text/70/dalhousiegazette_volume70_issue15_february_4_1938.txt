Council Decides

For Year Book

The decision of the Council has been
reversed and this vear we're to have a
Year Book. That wasthe chief item
that was decided last Sunday at the
Council meeting. The large machine
of the Medical Society was pressed into service for this purpose, Phi Chi Fraternity taking the first step.

The position of Advertising Manager
for which no applications had been
previously received, was given to Blois
LePage, a student in Arts, on the endorsement of the aforementioned Fraternity.

The speakers for the Medical Society
were Chester Stewart and Roy Gold.
Mr. Stewart waxed quite eloquently
on the merits of a Year Book, to the
University as an advertising project
and to the students for its sentimental
value,
boys in tears telling of his thankless
eftorts last vear, and how the internes
who had contributed so much to the
University deserved this little token.
He said the students, individually,
wanted the book, and there’s no reason
why they shouldn't have it.

_ “Would it be too late to have it out
on Munroe Day,” said Mr. MacKeigan.
On that the Medical Society were a little

é indefinite, but Mr. Gold said he couldn’t

see any real advantage in getting it
out on that day. The Council disagreed with him. Mr. Gold also
stressed the need of an active Gazette
campaign and the full support of the
Council.

Recruits Sought

Last Monday, at twelve o'clock,
Flight Lieutenant F. R. Millar of the
Dept. of National Defense delivered an
impassioned address to a group of admiring students. It seems that these
are troubled times and that, consequently, the Canadian government has
decided to augment its air force by
eighty Flying Officers, making a grand
total of some two hundred and fifty
Flying Officers. Formerly, membership in the-force as a Flying Officer was
restricted to graduates of Engineering
Schools. Luckily for the rest of us who
are interested, one can now be a Flying
Officer if even if one has only graduated
with an Arts degree, and provided that
one fulfills the general requirements of
intelligence, health, ete. A change has
been made in the period of preparation,
also. Whereas, before, one could become a Flying Officer by taking a series
of summer courses during one’s undergraduate years, now one must study
for a year after graduation before one
can earn the wings of a Flying Officer.
Anyone interested in becoming a Flying Officer need only to speak to Flight
Lieutenant F. R. Millar, and he will
tell you if he considers you worthy of
upholding the ideals of truth and democtacy that a country of Canada's
greatness invariably stands for. At
any rate, we can all try, and who knows
—perhaps one of us will have the
honour of defending Canada’s virtue
from the air in the next war.

There are still several o penings

for parts in the Munro Day
| Show.

Watch Bulletin for Rehearsal
Dates.

The Year Book urgently desires that all prospective graduates have their photographs
taken immediately.

With the opening of parliament

all eyes are expected to focus on the
Munroe Room in the Forrest Building

will convene for the first time in two
years. On Friday, Jan. 28, the members of the Law school voted that there
should be a Mock Parliament this year
and immediately the Liberals, Conservatives and Independents held their
party caucuses behind closed doors.
Later in the day it was officially announced that the following leaders had
been selected:

by the Third year class which is admittedly the most diflicult year of

exams in the course of eight days
This fact, adding to the shortening of
their term, without any decrease in

roused Meds action. The

From authoritive sources it is learned
that the reason for the action on the
part of the Faculty has been the widespread skipping of classes, particularly
clinics, when examinations have been
held during the mid-term, immediately
following the completion of lectures
in some of the shorter courses.

= ‘CLOSED INCIDENT

_ The Shirreff Hall incident is closed. The complete story
from the startling beginning to a successful finish is published on
Page 4 of this issue. It is a story of feminine ingenuity, our
old. friend “college spirit’’ and co-operation between students and
| faculty. So far the post Christmas term of 1988 is notable for two
examples of both co-operation and spirit. One is the awakening
of Delta Gamma and the ends accomplished at Shirreff Hall and
the other is the spectacular rise of the Dalhousie Band. To both
these bodies go our heartiest congratulations. They have extria cated themselves from the lethargic morass which appears to have
-_—_—_— bogged down the majority of our student societies during the current year, and have set before us an example well to be followed.

; The girls of Delta Gamma evidently followed a planned cam-- paign. The statement on Page 4, which is more or less official,
tells us that from the first “breaking’’ of the story in the Gazette
three weeks ago a group at the Hall had a definite end in view.
_ The question of the annual dance was merely a cat’s-paw used to
bring attention to conditions then existing at the Hall, namely,
the lack of facilities and the high price of meals for co-eds residing
P in the City. That this group at the Hall was working for the bet

ulf of the students of Dalhousie we thank Miss MacKeen,
s other authorities who are connected with the Hall, and the executive and members of Delta Gamma for giving us a more closely
- knit university and a concrete example of college spirit.

Of the Band no more need be said. Through the criticism and
_ ridicule of last term they “stuck to it.” Through the praise and
eulogy of this term we can only hope that they will stick to it.
_ The Band has earned the sincere thanks of every student at Dal_housie. At hockey games attended by less than fifty students,
_ the Band, ten or twelve strong, support their team. Consider the
Band and follow its example.

AGAIN—ELECTIONS

Time marches on and so does another college year. Another

_ month, now, and we will see the old question of, “who will our new
_ leaders be-”’ cropping up again. Yes, Campus Day is drawing

near and once more all students will be going to the polls and

to various meetings to vote in new officials.

Much water has flown under the bridge since Kelly Morton
wrote: “Dalhousie student life is diseased with fraternity politics’’
but conditions have not changed a whit since his violent denunciation of the ‘railroading’ that goes on at this university. Last year
a Gazette editorial featured the following statements that are all
too true—‘‘A get-together of leading spirits in fraternities and other
cliques and an agreement to let elections be run purely on the
merits of the individual would be only a temporary palliative.
_ The defect is in the general attitude of the student to politics, which
--——s attitude is in imitation of their elder’s attitude in national, pro_ vincial and civic politics.” The correction of this would be a
Utopia that is never likely to come true, but even so all students
should endeavour to erase the evil and conduct themselves in an
intelligent manner when they cast their vote. A well-known politician once said that he learnt more of dirty politics in his four years
at college than in all his years in the national spot-light.

and Fact
By lL, A. KITZ

Bennet on MacKay

Former students of Prof. MacKay
met with amusement the attack by
R. B. Bennett on our genial professor.
The words “hitter partisan’’ somehow
just don’t fit MacKay. Personally the
writer feels he always leaned towards
equivocation.

Mr. Bennet claims a book is being
written by the Professor, There are
errors in the work. Since however, as
he says proofs are being circulated and
changes are being made that would
see to point to acceptance of criticism, rather than a narrow partisanship.

The magnificent forceful three hour
speech in which the above was but a
trifling part, however, shows that the
leader of the Opposition has lost none
of his vigour or driving force. For that
matter Mr. Bennett is admirably suited
to lead an opposition. His power and
personality well fit him for the scrutinizing role of Notator of Errors and
Cmissions.

Privy Council

We do feel for the Leader in his remarks of his government's attempt to
pass legislation for Unemployment Insurance a few years ago. The Conservative Party have been exposed to a
more harsh criticism for that unconstitutional attempt than they deserve.
All our legislation on constitutional
matters has its final appeal before the
Judical Committee of the Privy Council. Persons who think the United
States Supreme Court is a vacillating
body should be referred to this august
group who interpret Canadian legislation.

lf it be true that the Devil himself
knows not the mind of man, it is doubly
true that a Federal government couldn't
be expected to know the latest attitude
of the shuttlecock mind of the Privy
Council.

I bet all my dear readers have been
waiting anxiously for the little joke
in Latin I promised them last week.
I can no longer keep you in suspense
(And don't think that it’s because I
can’t think of anything else to write
about—not after the glee club the other
night.) The story is that a Latin
teacher when asking for an example of a
cognate accusative in Latin received
the answer: “Bonam vitam vito.”
I hope vou smiled at least. [ should
hate to think the efforts of my Latin
instructress were in vain.

“THE PLAY’S THE THING

Glee Club. In the strange vernacular
of the day, it has been taking a beating. Apparently the public didn’t
like the show last Tuesday. Some of
it was quite good. The costumes

kitchen chairs could fit only one period.

convinced that the Glee Club could
put over quite a good burlesque show.
Nothing serious. Remember last year
they tried ‘‘Hay Fever,” of which the
author has been known to write that
it was one of the most difficult plays to
produce he had ever encountered. Of
course he was speaking of professionals,
and it is doubtful if he ever saw a Glee
Club production. From that limbo
of forgotten men, Internity, comes, too,a
plaintive cry. It looks bad for this
Reunion. Even the undergraduates
are feeling that the University has deserted them, so what will those who
have been dwelling apart for a decade
feel? We must have a good Glee Club.

Nowadays one cannot run a_ college
with only an excellent faculty to work
with, that is impossible. It’s hard,
of course, to see why not, but really,
to-day the ability to harangue a mob
in Greek is not enough. Not nearly
enough. To be effective must
also put on a bit of the Gaelic, and a
and a touch of English. The English

APOLOGIA

This business of Japan sending notes
of apology seems to have caught on
here at Dal. Never let it be said that
we don’t catch on fast here. No one
wants credit for the front page of last
week's effort. In fact some have gone
the limit to be excused. What lingering sympathy I may have had for the
Japs has disappeared when I realize
what they have done by their example.
Of course the page gave me a raison

make no complaint. It is the principal
of the thing. Dances the hotels

eg a. ery and Music” is primarily
E a bound copy of the scripts Deems
Taylor has used in past broadcasts of

the Philharmonic Sunday afternoon

concerts. As such, the book has few
pretensions. If you like Deems Taylor on Sunday afternoons, you wil
like him in his book. And if you
don’t, you won’t. As a matter of
fact, part of the magic of “Of Men
and Music” is that you can hear the
author reading to you, which gives
him a head start over most other
authors, because he knows best what
emphasis he wants placed where.

Some of the material for his book

has been reprinted from various essays
of his that have appeared elsewhere
in magazines.

“Of Men and Music”’ is notable for
two reasons. It provides one with a
set of interesting comments on practically every phase of musical activity;
and it gives one an insight into the
tao character of one Deems Taylor, music
' critic and a very vital person. One of

Taylor's chief charms is that he is

Victorian enough to have _ sensible

and interesting ideas and modern
- enough to express them clearly and
; vigorously. Here is what he has to
pe say of the new music:

“Many modernist composers and
their advocates remind me of a cook
who should suddenly tire of doing
, things with the same old flour and

salt and pepper and beans and lamb
chops, and should forthwith proceed
to invent dishes composed of benzine,
shavings, quinine, oystershells and
_ crank-case lubricant.

“The cook would have a_ perfect
right to do this, of course. But it
would hardly prove him to be a good
cook, if when you exclaimed, ‘This is

nasty, and I don’t think it agrees
ae with me’, he were to reply, simply:
Kea, ‘But, you fool, it’s supposed to be
nasty!’ The old flavors are outmoded.

The old conceptions of sweet and
sour and bitter must give way before

a newer, freer handling of flavor,
aes. ore: closely akin to the pulsating,
gar oh “unsentimental, clean-cut: life of the
Piel ‘machine age. As for its not agreeing |
5 phish sa you, that is no concern of mine.

- Food must be purified, purged of its

nineteenth-century burden of bour
_ geois nutritive values!”’

. On the other hand, Taylor has not a
fs -_ statie aversion to modern music.

at He devotes an entire lecture to the
praising of Alban Berg's “Wozzeck’’.
He makes innumerable pleas for the
tolerant ear, continually urging that a
piece be not condemned merely because it is new or because it seems
unpleasant on the first hearing. From
this it can be seen that Deems Taylor
has a two-mindedness just sufficiently
vacillating to be human. Here is
another instance of the same thing.
With van Loon, he says that a genius
ms is an artist. first and a technician
7 second. At the same time, he would
. say that no man can be an artist who
: has not a complete technical control
of his medium. There is barely enough
contradiction in the two ideas to prohibit
a less broad-minded man fron countenancing them both at the same time.
It is this ability of Deems Taylor to
see and to approve two rather different
ene points of view that fits him so well to
Te be a music commentator, and which
makes his observations so fascinating
. to the impartial layman that most of
onal us are.
Nothing much need be said about
the subject matter as such of “Of
. Men and Music.’’ A man who preachFe es as beautifully as Taylor can say
jittle that is not interesting. A rapid
survey of the index will show that
a he has expressed opinions on Wagner,
a man who never kept a friend whom
he couldn't use, and how he managed
to pay his debt to the world; on the
technical inefficiency of the instruments
of a past age; on Walter Damrosch
and what he did for Americans; on the
trouble with starving in a garret;
on the cult of incomprehensibility in
opera; and so on. Happily enough,
_ his style is so provocative and unobscured that you never find yourself
afraid to disagree with him. In fact,
‘many people have disagreed with him,
quite vociferously. He tells an amus-. ing story of a girl who wrote to him

DALHOUSIE GAZETTE

 

Lately there seems to have been a
‘lot of fur flying about on the campus.
At least the dear old college spirit appears to have raised its head again as a
result of the Delta Gamma _ fiasco.
In fact a lot seems to have been said
on every subject worth criticising, and
still is being said, but if it leads to a
bigger and better Dalhousie by all
means let us lend a helping hand. We
are, therefore, trotting forth our pet
grievences in the hope that something
will be done about them in this present
Renaissance!

One of them is the inaccessibility
of University regulations which results
in the student’s general lack of knowledge concerning minor campus rules.
Not the least of these is the one regarding card playing on University
grounds. As far as we can gather card
games of any kind are prohibited on
the campus. Upon considering this
rule with an unbiased mind it seems
rather a petty one. It would appear
that college students are not adult or
capable of exercising their faculties of
discretion. This rule was apparently
instigated because gambling had been
taking place and the results might be
harmful to the students. But wherever
you find young people—students in
this case—gathered together the element of chance is bound to enter.
Bridge and poker are probably the most
popular card games and the ones most
associated with gambling, but remove
these and substitutes immediately, take
their place. It is just as easy to bet
on checkers and ping-pong as it is on
bridge and the results are the same—
harmless at Dalhousie. The average
student is not interested to any great
degree in gambling. The prohibition
of poker is understandable but why
bridge, rummy, forty-fives or even old
maids? The usual—at least adult
stakes-are 1-40 ofa cent, which amounts
to under $2.00 per four hours, and if any
one wants to struggle for four hours for
that amount he is welcome, but I
hardly think any one considers it worth
the effort. There are bound to be the
rated few who would outstep this limit,
but hardiy with disastrous results to
Dalhousie’s good name. There is a
tale of a jealous group of players who
defied this rule when it was first enforced. As a result the tables were removed from the men’s common room,
thereby hoping to stop all activities on
that score, but the class pictures from
the hall walls were found to make admirable tables despite their weight on

 

 

Species Male
Case Analysis

(With apologies to the Engineers of
Manitoba University).
After lengthy experiment and _ investigation, the following enlightening
report has been drawn up, being a
complete account of the species male,
as it occurs at Dalhousie University.
Element-— Men.
Occurrence—Because of women.
Most desirable specimens invariably
found in the combined state. Perfect
specimen not yet discovered.

Physical Properties—Assorted sizes,
all equally drab and uninteresting in
appearance. Face covered with stubbly film. Undesired effect if not handled with sufficient tact.

Chemical Properties—Very active in
the presence of women. Possesses
great affinity for wine, women and
sequel. Violent reaction in the dark.
Unknown capacity for food. Susceptible to flattery. Commonly suffers
from ailment known as paralysis of
the pocketbook.

Oh, give me the girl who is sweet and
true,
- Who is innocent, artless, and pure;
With a mind as clean as a new-born
babe’s,

And a gaze that is shy and demure.

Oh, give me the girl with the unkissed
lips,
Oh, give me the girl who can blush,

Oh, give me the girl who is modest and
sweet,
Would she ever get the bum’s rush! !

four pairs of long suffering knees.
Necessity was ever the mother of invention, At any rate the majority of
students think that there should be
some provision for recreation in this
field. After all, bridge is just as mucha
national game as golf, and a knowledge
of it is practically essential in modern
life. We get it at home so why not at
college? Other colleges see fit to have
union rooms where students are allowed to play bridge and other games.
The rule might be justifiable if any
real harm was done, but can’t Dalhousie students be trusted? Why
would it not be possible to use the men’s
common room in the Arts Building.
It is large and comfortable and, on consideration, is probably the only room
suitable for such a purpose on the
campus. If mixed bridge is allowed at
Sherriff Hall at the At Homes on Saturday nights—this fact is not concrete
at the date of writing but being agitated
for, why then cannot it be extended
tothe campus inthe daytime? We feel
that such an object is worth supporting
since it fosters a feeling of friendship
and unity which is not exactly prominent at the present. A room where students can get together for the sake
of amusement—bridge or otherwise—is
essentially necessary in University life.
Another grievance is the absence of
mixed ping-pong. There is mixed
tennis and mixed badminton so why
not mixed ping-pong? There
excellent tables in the gym,
one could be spared for this purpose.
It could be placed on the stage, or, if
that proved inconvenient, why not in
the front entrance lobby of the gym
There is plenty room there and it is
used only on state occasions. We have
heard that the band is endeavouring
to practise there, instead of their present quarters in the Black Hole of Calcutta in the boys’ locker room, where
chairs, football regalia, etc., are stored.
A schedule dividing the time could be
drawn up, however, if any clashes occurred. The best idea of all to our
mind is mixed ping-pong in our chimerical union room. Thinkof it. Pingpong, bridge-—chess and checkers, if
you will—even magazines and papers
all for the asking. Is it not a glorious
idea? Last term the basement of the
old gym was proposed for use, but
wherever it is we should give it our
whole hearted support and strive for a
more compact Dalhousie. P.S. What
a feather it would be in the cap of our
centennial year!

Commission Sits
On Tribulations

The Editors,
Dear Sirs:—

I humbly submit for publication to
the student body my meager report of
the happenings of the first session of the
latest Royal Commission at Dalhousie
University. Perhaps I should say at
the beginning, to avoid any misunderstanding later on, that this report was
read, approved and endorsed by the
entire body as a fair picture of what
took place.

This Commission was suggested and
appointed by the combined efforts of
the higher authorities of our College
by the Sea. That would include, I
need hardly mention, the President,
the Senate, the Committee on Studies,
a very capable committee of the ablest
Profs. from all the various Faculties,
the Students Council, part of the Registrar’s Office, the D. A. A. C. executives,
the Glee Club exceutives, the Gym
Committée and last, but of course,
not least, all those who are too old to
enjoy dancing. | should say that
later these various groups were divided,
as we shall see, into committees and in
order to give the whole some semblance
of order where designated by numbers,
in the order in which they appear and
by these numbers we shall know them
hereafter. All combined together
they formed the magnificent committee of the whole. A great conglomeration, sez you. And indeed I agree.
But nevertheless, a worthy group;
the choicest of all Royal Commissions.
And I suggest that they cannot help
but give us some delicate recommendations, whether we care to abide by
them or not.

The Commission was appointed to
inquire into and discuss the problems
which are liable to handicap to some
extent what we want to be our gala
Centennial celebration this summer.

The 2 Friday's
Supreme Moot Court opened exceptionally early at 2.09 with Chief Justice
Rogers and Justices MelIntyre and

for the appellants while respondents
were represented by J. Petrie, K. C..,
and C. Smith. All lawyers tongratulated the judges on their recent elevation to the bench, apparently forgetful of the fact that their lordships were
old timers.

The sport began when Mr. Justice

mis-spelling in his brief. ‘As editor

respondent's brief. He leaped on the
word ‘“‘suggested’’ spelled with an
extra ‘‘s’’ and refused to accept Mr.
Petrie’s explanation that his ‘‘beautiful

again an ice cream fine im

ever, his lordship said ‘No, I deprecate the policy of trying to get something
for nothing,” and he scroed Mr, Justice
Katz, habit of using his wig and gown
to legalize his predacity.

Judgment was finally rendered in
favour of the respondents, and court
was about to adjourn when Mr. Justice
Cameron sought to have Mr. Justice
Katz arraigned before the full bench
of the Moot Court. The charge was
that during the proceedings he had

had made a crime, and therefore as a
result of his criminal record was unworthy of his oflice. The bench frowned on the procedure, however, and Mr.

There is no greater service man can
perform for his fellowman than to alleviate his pain when he suffers, mend
his body when he is unwell, and minister to him when he is in need. In
nobody, lest it be the physician, is
placed the power to perform such acts,
of mercy as in the dentist. As such
he is comparable to the minister and
physician, and due a like measure of
respect.

Yet subconsciously, it becomes difficult to accord the dental students at
Dalhousie the respect and honour
rightfully due them when one observes
the miserable mess they have made of
their dental society.

The dental society isno more. Why?
Mainly because the society was divided
into a number of cliques and because
at a meeting these would-be professional men behaved more like inmates
of the Nova Scotia Hospital. One
clique wanted a dance, another a smoker, and another a lecture. Each would
not pay dues if an affair contrary to
their inclinations was run. But mainly there were those who were afraid
they would not get two dollars worth

7 A Report ]

 

BY MARGARET DRUMMIE

When the attention of the meeting

could be brought to the business at
hand an article to be sent to the
Gazette was read and approved by
the meeting. It set forward the first
planks of the girls’ platform for Delta
Gamma unity. A committee of four
Was appointed to \investigate the
matter. The meeting, chiefly noteworthy for the fact that opinions
were given without being asked tor and
that there were several people throughout clamouring for the floor, was
adjourned,

Two days later a second meeting
was held. It was brief and—to some—
bewildering. The dance was indefinitely postponed, and the idea of holding
it off the campus was more or less
abandoned. This was done as a
gesture of co-operation toward those
in authority, and in view of certain
announcements which the committee
hoped to be able to make within the
next week. It was felt that at that
stage the whole matter was better
left in the hands of the committee
and that the less publicity given it,
the better. It was here that the
Gazette showed a very much appreciated
spirit of helpfulness. The editors very
kindly re-arranged their paper to
cut out articles that might be of some
disadvantage to the committee in
their work, and at the same time to
give the students as much news as
was possible at the time. This was
done at great inconvenience to themselves and was an example of the
unity and co-operation among student
organizations, much needed at this
university.

The  committee’s announcements
came surprisingly soon. Working with
great speed and in close understanding
with the Warden of Shirrefi Hall,
they were able to tell the girls that
same night that all the concessions
asked had been granted. Rooms in
the unoccupied basement wing of
Shirreff Hall are being fitted up as
They

An
extra table is set in the dining room
‘| for city girls who wish to have lunch
there. The price of lunch has been
reduced to 30c. by the business office.
The Hall will be open until twelve
o’clock every Saturday night from
the first of February for both Hall
and city girls, and their guests. Credit
should be given to the committee for
their fine work. In three days they
succeeded in obtaining every concession. This, of course, would not
have been possible without the help
of the Warden of the Hall, who took
up the matter with great interest and
who carried the girls’ requests to the
necessary higher authorities. Miss
MacKeen has earned the thanks of
every member of Delta Gamma for
the work she has done, as does President
Stanley for his ready consent to their
plans.

It is hoped that every girl will
avail herself of these new privileges.
It was the girls who voted for them
and it is the girls who are to use them.
The city girls must feel that they
have a right to go to the college residence at any time. Saturday nights
at the Hall should and can be one of
the primary factors in Dalhousie’s
social life, and what has been obtained
need only be a_ beginning towards
Delta Gamma unity and ‘‘Shirreff
Hall for the girls” if the authorities
are shown that Delta Gamma appreciates what has been done and
makes use of it. .

Why Professors Turn Grey

Recently a certain English professor
complained that the Radio and Movies
were lowering the standards of present
day youth and that something ought
to be done about it. Now, this statement naturally aroused our curiosity
since the same professor admitted
that never had he met with such fine
material as he has had to work with
during the past few years at Dalhousie,
but never has he met with such poor
results as he obtained. We feel that
a vital subject had been touched upon
and consequently went snooping about
to see if the students themselves provided any material for research work.
The following conversation between
several co-eds may throw some light
upon the subject, but please remember
that all names are fictitious!

“Thank Heaven, a whole spare
hour till English IIT. Anyone have a

cigarette?”
“Thanks, Jean. That's three I owe
you. Where’s the morning paper?

I want to see what’s on at the Capitol.”’
“T think ‘‘Conquest”’ is coming. You
know I saw the most perfect show
last week with Robert Taylor in it.
Boy, if somebody here could make
love like that, college would be worth
coming to, instead of learning all this
junk about Chaucer and Milton.”’

“Oh, I don’t know. Personally I
go in for Mickey Mouse!”’

“Did anyone see Carol
in ‘‘True Confession” and the way she
did her hair~ [I spent all last night
trying to make mine curl like that.
Oh my gosh, I just remembered those
four Latin sentences... ."'

“Have any of you seen the preview
of Lily Ponds’ new picture? Do you
realize she lost fifteen pounds doing
it, while I go to P. T. every day and
get fatter and fatter.”

“Too bad Mae West has gone out
of style, isn’t it?”’

“Look here the paper says Nelson
Eddy gets more fan mail than Jeanette
MacDonald, but I stick up for a
Canadian star every time. Isn’t it
too bad she couldn’t sing over the
radio last week on account of her
cold?”’

“That reminds me Grace Moore's
on tonight and I’ve got a poly-science
theme to do—oh well I'll just have
to squeeze it in tomorrow and hope

“Yes and I’ve got work to do for
English II and Bennie told us to see
‘Victoria the Great’. Says we'll get
more out of it than half a dozen lectures.
What a man!” _

“T wish Wilson would tell us to
see ‘‘Wells Fargo’’ for History 18.
Too bad there aren’t a few of him

on the campus.”

“Girls, did I tell you that I have a
date with Gordon tonight—”

“Not Gordon S. The boy that
looks like Tyronne Power~ You lucky
thing! What you've got that I haven't
got?”

‘‘Nice work if you can get it, isn’t
it? I simply must see that show.
['m so behind with my swing that
I'll just have to take a couple of nights
off to learn all the new songs.”

“You're right. My word do you
realize that it’s five to twelve and
I still haven’t done those sentences.
Why if I could do my declensions
the way I can tell you who's who in
Hollywood, I'd be getting somewhere.”’

“Oh well, Latin’s dead so what's the
difference.”

“Who said Latin was dead,
about Veni, veni, veni?”’

“Oh, here’s what’s on at the Capitol,
“Conquest”. ‘That drama that staggered
the whole world. It unites the screen’s
greatest dramatic lovers in a produc
what

tion of immeasurable scope, heartstabbing power and brilliance!’ How’s
that? Well, there's the bell so I

must dash. See you soon.”

Well you can draw your own conclusions from the above, but it seem
that our English professor was right.
Of course this paints only one side
of the question, but it shows that
motion pictures influence the standards
of speaking, thinking and studying.
Good or bad, we leave you to judge

The recent Delta Gama excite.
ment brought to light, quite incidentally, a very interesting point of view
which is this. College students, in the
eagerness with which they seize upon a
trivial problem and gnaw it to emotional bits, show an immaturity out of
all proportion to their years. This is
not an absolutely correct interpretation of the facts. I think that most
students realize and sometimes regret
the pettiness and narrow-mindedness of
their lives. The trouble is that there
is not a great deal that can be done

‘about their situation.All members of

an organization as all-inclusive as an
University develop a certain smallness
of mind. For instance, a member of
the W. C. T. U. spends her whole life
combatting the evil of drink, and yet
her efforts are just as silly and futile
as those of any of our college crusaders.
There don't seem to be enough universal ideas to provide meat for everybody. And since a mind must chew
on something, most of its food is very
poor stuff. Therefore, when a student
gets excited because it is reported that
authoritarianism has again reared its
ugly head, it isn’t so much because it
is authoritarianism that is doing the
rearing, or even because the thing has
an ugly head, but merely because
getting excited is good fun and lots of
exercise for the nervous system. Any
psychologist would call it a form of
complex-removing. And so, dear
friend, critic of the college life, judge
not too harshly our mental indiscriminateness, because such is only a form
of growing pains from which few of us
ever rid ourselves.

 

Dental Explorer

(Continued from Page 4)

Such is the post-mortem findings of
the Dental Society—a dissolved, disorganized muddle. Your reporter
would like to take this opportunity
of expressing his extreme regret that
such a worthy organization, which offered infinite chances for education and
social entertainment, has been allowed
to die. And also to commend the
president at having tried so hard to

_| keep the society going and for succeeding as long as he had—which is an

achieveme nt.

_ During the past month an innovation was introduced into the dental
profession which will have far-reaching
and entirely undesirable effects. We
refer to the secondary picketing of
dentist's offices by members of a technician’s group that is attempting to organize the dental laboratories. It is
one of the most degrading things ever
associated with the profession.

However, we believe in the necessity
for unions and are entirely not antiunion. But we are antagonistic to
secondary picketing which reduces a
profession to the lay shopkeeper whose
working girls are demanding—" Wages
up, hours down, make this place a
union town.’ Just something to make
you think. :

We are looking forward with great
expectancy to the coming show to be
put on by the dental students. Something big is brewing and if it goes as
planned, Dalhousie is in for a pleasant
surprise.

A worthwhile statement by Justice
Hughes—“‘Inducing patronage by representations of painless dentistry;
professional superiority; free examination; and guaranteed dental work was,
as a general rule the practice of the
Charlatan and quack to entice the
public.”

Commission Sits

(Continued from Page 3)

The first meeting was a very iniportant one. The President was there,
and when the session began he ws in
real character, the very image of a Greek
god, but sad to relate, before the evening had progressed very far, he was so
besmeared with cigarette ashes and so
dishevelled and tossed about that one
could not tell where his suit ended and
his grey locks began.

When the great multitude had assembled in room three of the Arts
Building, (the other places not being
large enough) the first question that
arose was the selection of a chairman
for the meeting. The president took
it upon himself to say, ‘I will be Chairman.”’ And naturally, as he was president no one openly disputed his right
to sit in the only chair in the room ona
raised platform. But many present
had an envious look in their eyes,
which suggested that they thought
that perhaps they could handle the
chair better, or at least as well. However, their countenance gradually became less envious and changed to pity
in most cases because handling such a
body One fellow even seemed to enjoy the embarrassment in which he saw the poor
chairman labouring. He should be
more careful not to be too open about
his glee, as in the past some have gone
west for just that thing.

Was not an easy task.

Loud was the din at the opening of
the first meeting. The chairman took
his place and called for order, but little
order resulted. The fun realiv began
when the chairman ““Gentlemen, the English language does not afford me terms adequate to my feelings
on this tremendous occasion. [ must
have recourse to the French or some
other language.”

‘No! no!” Was the unanimous
answer. But glee of the utmost appreciation sparkled from the unsparkling eyes of a certain member of group
three. I agree this committeeman
sputtered and waived his stubby mitts
before his little frame.

“Well,” continued the chairman,”

what made thein so uncomfortable)

“Let's divide into committees and

“Will you be quite and stop useless

talk,” interjected the chairman—‘‘just
aminute. All of group five seems to be
asleep.”’

“How natural,’’ laughed many.

Just then a disturbance at the back
of the room grew to outlandish proportions and it was found that various
members were arguing over the best,
or shall we say thé worst, joke in a well

worn edition of an old Calgary ‘‘Eye
Opener.”

“Mr. Committeeman of number
seven,”’ yelled someone, ‘‘please put

aside that cheap rag and stop arousing
the amorous propensities of certain
members.”
‘Sa pristi,”’
was bothered.
The committman, being slighted before his members, said in defence, ‘‘You
can never be wise unless you love reading.”
“QO, si sic omnia.’
‘let's be serious.”’

At this point the chairman took a
dictatorial stand and appointed committees. The meeting then adjourned
at 2.47 a.m.

- Battle In New Glasgow One Doping The Dopes
Of Season’s Fastest Games

Coming from behind in the last
period to tie the score, New Glasgow
Seven Up's continued their undefeated
march through the Nova Scotia Hockey
League last Friday night by driving
home the winning goal in overtime
against the Dal Tigers. The Tigers
outplayed the New Glasgow boys for
more than two periods and were leading 8-1 when the league leaders suddenly began to click and in spite of the
sensational goal tending of Koretsky,

. who turned in one of the finest exhibi
‘tions of net minding ever seen in New
Glasgow, succeeded in turning back
the Collegians 4-3.

While Koretsky was playing heads
up hockey in the Dal cage, Sunny MacDonald also turned in some noble efforts at the other end of the ice for
Seven Up's. During the first two
periods it was MacDonald who kept
the Tigers from piling up a large lead,
as they swarmed all around the New
Glasgow cage in a mad scramble for
goals,

The Tigers went on the offensive

from the opening whistle and bottled

-up the home team inside their blue line
‘and kept them there. Great work by
the rival goalies and the inability of the
Dal boys to get the puck into the net

on the many occasions they were ritht
tai, kept the opening session scoreless.
Pye:

The middle period was a repetition

we ie the first with the Bengals always on
"the o oftensive and launching drive after |

drive on the New. Glasgow citadel.
MacGregor opened the scoring when
he went the length of the ice and passed
to Mont at the New Glasgow blue line
Mont went in and passed back to Mac
_ Gregor in front of the net who shoved

it in. Four minutes later Carmody
evened the count when he scored on a
passout from behind the Dal net.

Three minutes from the start of the
third period, Doug McDonald put Dal
one up when he took Mont’s perfect
pass and slammed his own rebound
behind Sonny MacDonald. One minute later Pooh DeWolfe, who. was a
tower of strength in the Dal attack,
split the defence and blazed a backhand shot into the net. At this point
it looked as if the Tigers would be the
first to set back the high flying Seven
Up’s but Dickson and McDonald came through with quick goals to
tie up the count.

In the overtime period, Conn was

while he was in the cooler, Carmody
sank Dickson’s pass to win the game.

 

Squash Court

It seems that the question of allowing students to use the squash court is
not a new one. Twice, now, have attempts been made to secure their facility for the benefit of the students
and twice have their efforts been balked. The latest endeavour, consisting
of interviews with men prominent in

’ gymnasium affairs, looks to be slightly
more hopeful.

An appeal for information from the
Senate Gymnasium Committee was
received with sympathy but this question lies outside their province, the
court being a part of the Faculty
Union. The search passed on to the
D. A. A. C. who said they were unable
to help in any way. They announced
that they had worked on it a year or so
ago, but nothing had happened. From
them, however, came a recommendation that the whole matter be turned
over to the Council who will carry it
before the Board of Governors. To
this end Councillor Fred Barton has
been appointed to examine the situation
_and make a report at some future date.
Rest assured, a determined effort is
being made,

Still in the midst of their losing
streak,. Dal Tigers dropped another
wide open game to Halifax Haligonians
on Wednesday night at the Forum.
When the final bell sounded, the
Tigers were on the short end of a 4-1

count. Once again, it was a repetition
of the previous Dal games. The
Tigers rushed the play inside the

Haligonians blue line for minutes at a
time and did everything but score.
Every now and then suffered costly
lapses and allowed the fast skating
Haligonian forwards to tear in on
a wide open goal to score.

The players of both teams carried
chips on their shoulders, and used
high sticks, knees, elbows, and everything else they could lay hands on
to chop down the opposing players.

Consequently there was always a
steady flow of belligerents in and out
of the penalty box.

Dal’s lone marker came from the
stick of Johnny Carroll, husky defenceman, who turned in his best game of
the year, bumping any and all comers.
With Flynn and Nelson in the cooler,
the Tigers turned on the power and
on a gang attack Carroll intercepted
a pass and drove a hard shot past
Burbidge after six minutes of the
second period. George Flynn was
the pick of the Haligonians, netting
two of their markers, Hopgood and
Nesbitt got the others.

Forced to shuffle his lines due to
injuries to Buckley and Keer, Coach
Ferguson played Don MacGregor at
centre on his second line, and Don
turned in a nice effort. Korky Koretsky, whose amazing exhibitions in
the Dal nets have been the talk of the
league, again turned in a striking
performance saving many sure goals
when the Haligonians were right in
on him.

 

Tigers Triumph

Repeating their pie-season victory
of two weeks ago, the Dal Tigers tock
a close decision from the Wanderers
at the Gym last night 28-25 in their
initial league meeting. The Bengals
turned in a spotty game, but flashed
enough form to overcome their Red
clas rivals, who were kept far out by a
tight defence. The shooting of both
clubs left much to be desired, but the
game made up in interest what it
lacked in the way of finished basketball and kept the fans interested.

The Tigers resplendent in their
new trunks started strong but the
Wanderers soon took command and
opened out a short lead in spite of a
Dal defence that kept them guessing.
The Reds managed to keep in front
as the Dal sharpshovoters found it
difficult to find the basket, but in a
torrid last five minutes the Gold and
Black ran through for a string of
baskets which regained them the
lead leaving them cn the long end
of the 17-14 half time score.

As the second half got under way
the Redmen fought back to bring
the score to a tie and then regain the
lead. The game roughened as the
pace increased and Dal called a time

out. Two quick baskets put the
Tigers on the Redmen’s heels and
they called time out in their turn.

The Reds stalled repeatedly, evidently
unwilling to try and solve the Tiger’s
close zone defence. A costly penalty
enabled Dal to tie the score and two
baskets were all they needed to put
them out in front for good,

The last few minutes were tense
as the Wanderers pressed to tie up
the score, but the Tigers beat off the
threat till relieved by the fina! whistle.

from the N.S. Tech by a score of 31-21.
Little basketball was shown,

in the running throughout the half
