Dear Mr. Editor:

We might’ be overstepping our
in attempting to use your
Gazette to express our sentiments,
Mr. Editor. For we are two of
thirty forgotten men at Dalhousie,
and find ourselves in that indescribable
position where we do not know whether
we are or are not members of our
student body. Heaven only knows
we and our colleagues have qualified
for that glorious privilege in a financial
way. We might add that we did so
without resentment, anxious still to
remain active Dalhousians for at
least one year more. We are pleased
to state that we have been active for
six years in the interests of our University but much like Jacob of the
Bible, the seventh was to bring utter
disappointment.

We say the situation is indescribable,

the rapidity with which we received
our weekly Gazette. On Monday
mornings we regularly received our
quota of the previous week’s publication. Yes! One Gazette for twelve
internes, twelve Dalhousians whose
only guilt seems to be an interest in
and a longing for the University of
which they still are members. At a
pre-Christmas Student Council meeting we registered our just complaint,
were told that was incredible; yet on
Janaury 24th, 1938, our trusty postman still persists in delivering his
single copy.

May we add that we have always
considered the Glee Club as the one
binding force in our student inake-up.
The number and caliber of the perxformances this year, we are told,
have been remarkable. To our knowledge there has been one legitimate
show before Christmas and of that
we must confess we were aware three
hours before the curtain rose, thanks
to a thoughtiul nurse who was fortunate enough to have a boy friend,
not a Dalhousie Student, of course,
‘who was going to the affair.

We ask you, Mr. Editor, whether
you too would not feel slighted at
such enforced ignorance regarding college activities. We have served this
same student body in various pusitions
in the past years, sincerely and to the
best of our ability. The difficulties
in satisfying all are well known to us,

Critic Scores
Tuesday’s Play

By the Gazette Drama Critic

 

*

On Tuesday night we had _ the
honour of witnessing probably the
worst show in the history of Dalhousie’s
Glee Club. We have been very charitable in writing up the last two show
for they were not good, but Tuesday's
night's presentation to use a
quaint term, just so much garbage.

Of the organizations who took part,
One presented an interesting feature,
one a mediocre feature and thelast a
bad feature. They are, however, not
totally to blame for the quality of the
show. They were evidently doing

was,

“their best, which of course is no excuse,

but the fact that they were bad did not
make a poor Glee Club Show. When
those gentlemen in charge of the
histrionic department can stage a one
act play, have a chorus sing two
numbers and have a band play three
numbers, and call the whole mess a
Glee Club Show, it shows either a

Hick of iniagination, or taste, or perhaps )
| even ability on their part.

The Choral Society was staged first,
singing two numbers, a piece of Sibelius “Finnlandia’', and a Czecho-Slovakian dance. The latter was admirably
done although it would have been
well for the basses to remember that a
conductor does not wave a baton for
his. own amusement. Of the former
we are afraid the ‘‘Uncrowned King

of Finland’’ would have been very
much annoyed. A true poem of
strong national feeling is not best |

interpreted with insipid listlessness.

The next number, a one act play
entitled “Women at War’ staged
by Delta Gamma seemed quite pointless, there being very little central
‘theme, and if so it was certainly not
projected to the audience. It seemingly attempts to show women’s reactions
to war, and although a timely piece,
it turns out quite typically, to be
another example of weak, sentimental,
anti-war bosh.

Perhaps the only exciting moment
of the play was when Joan Blackwood
entered disguised as Paul Revere.
The slowness of the piece was exemplified by Marjorie MacLean and Winnie
Flynn, who if anything showed a very
definite dislike of their parts. If it
hadn't been for their makeup they
might have been children of ten, for
in no way did they play. their parts
true to form except to make an attempt
at domestication. Shirley Kirkpatrick
and Mardi Schwartz were also weak,
Shirley sewed for ten minutes on a
piece of cotton 6 inches by 1 inch
(for bandages, we believe) and Mardi
gave forth a recipe as if she had just
memorized it before coming on the
stage. Ruth MacQuarrie was quite
competent, although at times descended
to burlesque, which incidentaily would
have improved the play one hundred
per cent, if they had all followed suit.
Betty Sandell added background and
answered the door.

There was a_ very ending,
none of the girls being very much
affected by the deaths of their husbands
and sons. Highly amusing was the
faint smile that creased Winnie Flynn’s
lips when she learned of the death of
her son. She was probably seeing him
in Heaven.

We print them merely to correct certain rumours prevalent on the

Permission to use Shirreff Hall for the annual Delta Gamma dance

was refused by the Warden of the Hall on her own decision.

The Ward
en had NOT been ordered to refuse by University authorities.
The Warden was acting quite within her authority when she gave

the refusal.

There have been three evening dances at the Hall this college year.
This was the Warden’s chief objection to the Delta Gamma affair.
For several years University officials have urged that student dances

be held on the campus.

Last year Delta Gamma staged their affair at

Shirreff Hall, to the gratification of authorities.

Pop Contest In
Moot Court

One of the most interesting social
events of the current term was Tuesday's session of the Supreme Moot

Court of Dalhousie. Court opened
at 2.30 p. m. sharp (one half-hour
late as usual) with Chief Justice
McKeigan and Mr. Justice Sheehan
presiding. Justices and counsel beam
ed at each other over bottles of pop.

Miss Allen, junior counsel for the
appellants, arose and congratulated
the judges, making her remarks short
and sweet. Court was then adjourned
for two minutes to allow Mr. Justice
Hanway, who had just appeared a
bit late, a chance to sneak onto the
bench as inconspicuously as possible.
oe Court reopened Miss Hirsch,

C. peered across the long row of
a lore and opened the argument
for the appellants in a vivacious and
forceful manner. Chief Justice McKeigan took a gulp of pop and his bottle
was half-empty. Miss Hirsch contended the respondents had been
negligent in caring for the appellant's
letter but she became distracted when
the Justices began to chuckle over
something or other and she was forced
to ask for order. Witness laughed
and Chief Justice McKeigan guzzled
another gulp of pop. The bottle was

thus emptied at 2.43. Later, in order
to illustrate a point, Miss Hirsch
tried to take possession of Mr. Hous
ser's pop but it had been finished at
3.01. (Mr. Housser had used three
straws). Counsel finished her appeal
at 8.40 and swallowed the rest of her
pop.

Mr. Housser, junior counsel for the
respondents, then (just as Miss Allen
was finishing her pop) tried to compliment the judges in a grandiloquent
manner but the Chief Justice realized
| he was ‘laying it on too thick”
et the compliments were
flous’. Mr. thumped _ into
his seat and Miss Drummie, K. C.,,
began the argument her clients
in a voice that was sweet and low.
At 4.20 she finished her case and also
her pop. Mr. Housser then appeared
with three straws and another bottle

and
“superHousser

 

for

which was finished instantly.
Miss Hirsch argued her rebuttal
for 20 minutes and then court was

adjourned to give their lordships a
chance to make up their minds. Mr.
Justice Sheehan had not touched his
pop, probably fearing there was a snail
jin it, but one of the counsels was not
afraid of snails and took a gulp as
she passed the bench. It was then
one-quarter full.

Their lordships returned and the
Chief Justice congratulated counsel
and gave judgment for the appellants.
Mr. Justice Hanway concurred, but
said he did not know why. What
Mr: Justice Sheehan said was therefore
of no importance. The battle of the
century was finished just tike the pop.

On

Obviously with greater things in
view, a motion to “‘postpone the annual
Delta Gamma dance indefinitely with
strong consideration to holding it in
the gymnasium” was slipped through a
well-attended meeting of the girls’ society yesterday in the Arts’ Building.
To a few male observers in the back of
the room it looked like the Flying Scot
on a record breaking run, whizzing
through a small village. Moved by
Zylpha Linkletter and seconded by
several well-trained voices, 48 beautiful
but .... coeds sprang to their feet in a
block in answer to President Pentz’
“All in favour—,’"’ There were about
60 present.

And so, long-suffering males are at
last put out of their misery. There
will be no Delta Gamma dance until
further notice, and then no one knows
where it will be held.

“One parliament is not bound by a
previous one’”’ and, after all it zs a
woman's privilege to change her mind.
At Tuesday’s Delta Gamma meeting
it was decided definitely to hold the affair at one of the hotels, if the committee could make arrangements. Also,
if possible, it was to be staged this
Monday night. Wednesday the girls
went before the Students’ Council at
a special meeting and received permission to transfer $40 from their budget
to meet dance expenses. What will
happen to the $40, is dubious, but it
was transferred only on the condition
that the dance would be held at an
hotel.

Hall Incident.

The whole fiasco was an aftermath
of the Shirreff Hall incident last week,
when the Warden of the Hall refused
the girls permission to hold the dance
in that building. For years previous
the co-eds of this campus had staged
their formal ball at a downtown hotel,
but last year, endeavouring to save
money, they decided to hold the party
at Shirreff Hall. Permission was obtained without difticulty, cavalier
males present reported it one of the
best parties of the year and university
authorities applauded the action of the
female students in their ‘‘back to the
campus’? movement.

The same plan was to be carried out
this year but a stumbling block appeared. The Warden of the Hall refused permission to Delta Gamma executives, mainly on the point that there
had been too many dances at the Hall
last tern, three to be exact—a freshman dance at the beginning of the
year, a dance in aid of the Halifax Community Chest in the middle of the
term and a House party. Other factors influencing the Warden’s decision
were the studies of the girls and allegedly the on the
Hall itself.

One

‘wear and tear’’

university authority suggested

the gymnasium as the logical ‘‘ballroom,’ but the co-eds disagreed.
The Haliburton Room at King’s Col
lege was also suggested as a possible

locale, but no ofticial action was taken.

So the girls held a meeting, decided to

GYMNASIUM

For the edification of those students who are unaware of the
fact that there is a Squash Court on the second floor of the gymnasium, We suppose many know of it, but how many have
seen it or played on it? The second floor of the gymnasium is
to the public, one of the most inaccessible spots at Dalhousie,
‘even more so than some of the sacred precincts on the Campus,
and it is a very unfortunate matter. .

We presume that the Gymnasium was built with the idea
that it should be used by and for all Dalhousians. By Dalhousians
we mean Faculty, Alumni and Students, primarily Students,
because it was for their pleasure chiefly that the building was
originally constructed. Why then, should a part of this edifice
- be removed from student use? We appreciate the fact that
. there is only one court and that this would tend to over-crowding,
but this problem can be handled quite easily.
Baie: Another court in this city handles the problem in a very simple
manner. Here, any player who wishes to use the court merely
telephones the janitor and reserves it for a short period at whatsever time is open. The same system could be employed here
rie and would save people the bother and disappointment of coming

A certain section of the Halifax Press has seen fit to mistreat

_--__ daily newspaper had blazoned across its front page, a main head____ line stating that Dal co-eds were fighting a dance ban. Replacing
- news of international importance as the chief story of the day,

__the article goes on to say that “Civil war threatened on the Dal

aie > This story presented to the public an altogether erroneous
‘impression of the true facts of the incident. It is not necessary
to elaborate on the circumstances. But as all Dalhousians are
aware, no group would rebel on such a trivial matter—and even if
they did they would soon be brought to their senses by the scorn
of the majority. It is hard to believe that a story appearing in a
student publication of interest only to the students themselves,
would be seized upon by a prominent newspaper, and spread
across Page 1 with a lead which gives free rein to public imagination
and allows a distortion of the true facts. We all know the truth.
Permission to hold the dance at the Hall was refused by the
Warden. Some students were indignant, others were not. But
the most indignant of them all certainly did not stand in “open
protest’’ against the University and if “civil war’’ were threatened
it must have been nipped in the plotting stage for it definitely

did not appear in the open.

We are sorry indeed to realize that a Halifax daily of good
repute considers it necessary to magnify the facts concerning this
incident. Petty itself in the minds of the students, to the general
public the tone and treatment of the article presents a state of
affairs which is non-existent at this University. Although the
story may have been interesting copy in a student publication,
we fail to see its benefit to the publisher of the newspaper in ques-tion—rather there may lie a detriment.

harnois, repudiation of contracts, denial of use of courts, election issues,

the bumptious ‘Mitch’ Hepburn—
all fit into a kaleidoscope of shrewd
juggling.

The story is an ever-changing one.
Hepburn before an election says he has
sufficient hydro powers. Quebec contracts are repudiated. Litigation ensues. The Ontario government is well
on its way to defeat in the court battle.
Then from a clear sky new contracts
are made. The price lowered.
No forms of guarantee are given that
these contracts will not also be cast
aside.

$79,000,000

“The Quebec power barons” as the
Toronto Saturday Night observes ‘‘surrender $79,000,000." Hepburn has
been quoted as saying by the Toronto
“Globe and Mail” that there is ‘‘little
expection” of Ontario winning the
court struggle for this large amount.

Why then do the Quebec interests
suddenly turn Santa Claus and forget
this fat sum which is apparently
rolling their way? The Winnipeg Free
Press with customary astuteness offers
a solution.

The Wedge

se

Electric power is one of the richest
products in Canada. The Federal
authorities have never countenanced
its exportation. The excellent reason
being if Canada sends out cheap
power to the United States the likelihood of United States factories nioving
into Canada or those at present operating here is certain to be severely
curtailed. But Quebec private companies have always longed to sell
surplus power. They have failed.
Ontario is now seeking that right.
As the “FREE PRESS” suggests, the
Queber interests have kissed goodbye
to $79,000,000, in the hope that
Ontario will have surplus power to
export. Then “if Mr. Hepburn gets
a license to export the
Federal Government ..... it will become comparatively easy for private
conipanies to yet similar licenses and
export power, too.”

The Free Press says further,
powerful lobby is being created

College Notes

A Reporter’s Joke

“The Syracuse Daily Orange” recently carried an amusing story of a practieal joke played by a female meinber
of its staff. Armed with a_ petition
and a sharp pencil, Ellen Conry set
about getting signatures for her petition, and succeeded in getting 115
names, or about 96° of the names of
the people she met. The next dav
photostatic copy of the petition was
printed in the “Daily Orange’. It
showed that 115 university students
had promised to serve a term of five
years on a Georgia chain gang, unless
they were granted that for which they
petitioned.

a

According to Miss Conrvy,# most
people merely took the paper agreeably
and signed without even glancing at
the petition. Others showed an interest in the contents but were satisfied
to have Miss Conry explain it to them
while they glanced at the typewritten
material. Some were more interested

in the names of the people who had |

already signed than in what they
were signing themselves. Of the 123
“candidates’’contacted,only 3 students
spotted the catch and refused to sign.

Like most practical jokes, this one
has a moral attached to it, which
probably is that you can’t believe
all the petitions you hear.

Virile Idealism

Four walls do not a college make,
nor does the mortar convey the sacrifice, vision, courage and work of which
it is the recipient. Tor,
the history
now running in the Dalhousie Review
by D. C, Harvey, one realizes just
what Dalhousie, with its splendid
buildings and beautiful campus, has
cost in human sacrifice, what trials
and tribulations have been borne
what thoughts and visions have been
required to found the first undenominational college in the British Empire
and to maintain it on this true basis of a
liberal education.

vantage of the many

tunities offered them during the rest

of the game and after sixty minutes
of fast bustling hockey, skated off
with a 7-5 victory over the Dalhousie
pucksters. The Tigers were always
at least one goal down and were forced
to play wide open hockey, and force
the Bearcats all the way. Thanks to
goalie Mumford who turned in a
sensational exhibition of puck stopping,
the Truro team managed to hold off
the Dalhousie tide and cash in on
fast breakaways to clinch the game.
Both teams played very clean hockey
and only three penalties were handed
out by the officials, one to Dalhousie
and two to Truro.

From the opening face off, Burgess
went in on the Dal goal and passed
to McLean who scored. A few seconds
later the same pair duplicated the
play with Burgess sliding the puck
into the net. After these sudden
scores, the Tigers pulled up their socks

and went right after the Bearcats and

were finally rewarded when Mont,

Conn and Buckley clicked on a_beauti
ful passing play with papa getting the
goal. *

In the second period, the Bearcats
again scored two quick goals by Ryan
and Beswanger before the Tigers could
get organized. Near the end of the
period with Dal playing “one man
short, Don MacGregor made a very
smart play when he skated slowly up
centre ice and shot towards the Truro
goal. Vhe puck got stuck behind the
net and MacGregor went in, brought
it around Mumford and slid it into
the far corner of the cage to the amazement of the whole Truro lineup.
One minute later DeWolfe swung
down centre and passed to MacGregor
who batted in his second marker to
cut the Truro margin to one goal.

The Collegians opened the final
period with a furiols gang attack
which missed by inches on at least a
dozen occasions. Halfway through the
period, Taylor scored on a long shot.
After this surprise goal, Dal fought
right back and Jack Buckley finaliy
scored on a gang play. Only one goal
dewn the College boys pressed desperately but once more Taylor scoredto increase Truro’s margin. MacGregor brought Dal within striking distance
again when he scored assisted by

The Band

The campus organization which deserves extra special mention this week
is the Dalhousie Band. It has set an example of achievement which puts other
of our worthy student groups to shame and may well show to the student body

Even the well-earned
reputation of Daihousie students as devotees of the dance seems to be in danger.

One outstanding exception is the little thought of Dalhousie Band.

Last term, the Band was as deep, if not deeper, in the doldrums than any
campus Beare They made brave attempts at two of the football games
but the majority of the apperances were not unqualified successes to put it most
charitably. To what is owed the sudden reversed of form so evident to- day?
We do not know, but would venture to suggest, that it is nothing more complicated than each member of the band deciding to make an efiort to do what they
had set out to do properly and to put a little spirit into 1t—a treatment, by the
way, which if applied by the students generally would havea rejuvenating effect
which would make this campus a diflerent place in a space of time, surprising
even to the optimists: However this may be, the fact is that the Dalhousie
Band to-day has improved at the very least 100% over last term.

We were present at the opening game of the hockey season a few wee ks ago.
The fine fighting spirit of the team and a really good performance by the band
created an atmosphere that evening which would have done any real Dalhousian’s heart good. We fondly hope that there are more real Dalhousians than
were there, but that remains to be seen.

Since then the Band have been the star turn at a Glee Club show and on
Wednesday night made another real contribution to the enjoyment of the few
faithful at the hockey match. All this goes to show that the organization which
had probably the poorest start of any has come out right on top. Now just why
is this?) You may ask. We think mainly because of interest and spirit—colllege

letics at college exist on nothing more nor less than student interest and if that
interest is withdrawn they die. Now it has come pretty nearly to the point
where athletics at Dalhousie are going to die or at least be seriously curtailed
unless there is a change of attitude by the student body. There may be a
sniall minority who would welcome the day when Dal's Rugby, Basketball and
Hockey Teams are things of the past and our athletic traditions forgotten.
But we believe that the great majority if ever faced with a definite choice on this
question would unhesitatingly vote for the continuance of athletics. [t is about
time that this niajority wakes up to the realization of the fact that they are even
now being faced with this — and that it calls for action.

Vast Improvement

The highlight of a bad evening was
the presentation of the Dalhousie
Band. Considering the poor performances at the football games last fall
the band receives our heartiest congratulations on its showing.

Quite obviously as much surprised
as the audience, the band rose to
inspired heights under the loud applause
they received. Particularly pleasing
to the fans were the “‘blats” from the
trombone section, which supplied the
comedy relief that the play lacked.

Realizing the fact that three band

stage the dance in an hotel, then held
another meeting two days later and reversed their decision.
