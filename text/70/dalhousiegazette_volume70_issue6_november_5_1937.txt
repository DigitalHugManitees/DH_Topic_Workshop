Intercollegiate Debaters To |

 

Argue First Meet Of Season

\/
OU

On Friday, Nov. 12 the intercollegiate debating season at Dalhousie
will open with the resounding clash
of heated verbal conflict, when jack
Finlay and Bob Wallick meet their
famed opponents fron: Quebec in a
fight to the finish on the timely resolution “That the sit-down strike is a just
weapon in the hands of organized
labour."” To meet the invaders, Sodales have chosen two of Dalhousie’s
most profound theorists and persuasive
orators and are confident that, whatever the outcome of next Friday's
titanic struggle, the cause of labour
will not have been without worthy
champions.

And well must Dalhousie’s defenders
acquit themselves, for this year the
National Federation of Canadian University Stude:ts is sending to the Maritimes men of the greatest possible attainments. ;
~ Mr. Sidney J. Davies of Bishop's

; _ University, the leader of the team, is
a student of wide experience in many

other than academic pursuits. An

_ Englishman by birth and a student in
Theology, he has attended public and

private schools in the Old Country and
in Canada, actively engaged in industry as an apprentice in the clothing
trade and worked on a farm near OtTawa. In student activities he has
edited his university magazine, captained the Soccer team, and participated in productions of the Bishop’s
Dramatic Society. In community affairs he has been prominent as Assistant Scoutmaster in Lennoxville
since he ent: red the university there.
In debate he is a key man, and last
year met the same travelling British
team we entertained in Halifax.

Mr. J. A. Dunn, who accompanies
Mr. Davies on the visiting team, is
also an Englishman, one of the many
Englishmen who come to Canada to
study Agriculture at Macdonald College, the Agricultural Faculty of McGill
University. A senior student specializing in Horticulture and Economics,
Mr. Dunn is President of the Macdonald College Debating and Dramatic
Society, last year’s President of the
Players’ Club, an enthusiastic footballer, and has been inter-collegiate
debater throughout his college career.

When one considers the experience
and the accomplishments of our opponents, he realizes that the Dalhousie
team will have their work cut out for
them next Friday night. So, remember
everyone turn out for our first big debate. Win or lose, it will be worthwhile to hear the significant topic
of the sit-down strike discussed by meu
of ability who have given weeks of
thought to their subject. Whether
you are interested in debate for debate’s sake, in politics as a future incumbent of high position, or as a future taxpayer; in law as a science of
social welfare, or a traditional theory
of reaction; in human progress as a
moralist, or as a pragmatist; in business as a radical, or as a reactionary,
you will be informed by the evenings
discussion, and glad that you came.

On Tuesday, Nov. 9, Dr. Benge

Atlee will speak at noon in

Room 3 of the Arts Building on
“In Quest of the Future.’’

 

Music Recitals

The students of the University are
going to have unusual advantages this
year in the opportunities they will have
to hear some splendid artists. Percy
Grainger is to play on January 18th
in the Dalhousie Gymnasium to be followed by Matzenauer in February.
In March a varied programme will be
given by the orchestra of the Halifax
Conservatory of Music. The Alumni
of the Conservatory have arranged
these concerts and by the assistance
of the University have been able to
secure these well known artists. As
the course tickets have a special price
for university students, probably a
goodly number will attend.

 

Dal Moot Court

Mindful of his duties to his indulgent
readers the iaw scribe renews his
respectful greetings, as he chronicles
the small beer of the guileless barristers.
The seeds regularly sown by the law
society fell so long on barren ground
that it is with some astonishment
that they view the blooms of their
scatterings. Upon the antedated,
sicxly-yellow, plastered walls has been
superimposed a fire extinguisher ina
delicate bronze: the old brown, wooden
scrap basket, one of the many relics
of the early century has taken a trip
to oblivion, and dame _ fashion
graced the law hall with an apple
green, metal basket of modern vintage.

Unmoved by these innovations in
its midst the machinery of the Moot
Court rolled relentlessly on, bringing
sweat successively to the brows of
Jim Milner and Gilbert Gaudet, Syd
Lithwick and Jack Sawlor, even to
Verne Read and Gordon Daley. In
addition it brought a gleeful conceit
to the judicial personalities of nine
third year men.

Giving a better performance with
cigars than in elucidating the Jaw,
Hanway and DeWolfe J. J. avoided a
judgment as Milner and Gaudet congregated a weight of authorities that
took the learned counsel three hours
to unravel. Gaudet citing cases ‘‘ad
infinitum” and Milner pulling distinctions as a magician pulls rabbits
from a hat, kept Babe Stewart on a
steady trot from the library to the
court room,

Syd Lithwick took the law of tort
by the tail, and with the aid of Justice
MacKeigan rapped it around Jack
Sawlor’s neck. The latter, after a
manful struggle, strangled to silence
as the appellant was given judgment.

by one P. I. H. Miuschamp, to which

There was ignorant man
whose thirst for information on things
spiritual and things worldly was so
great, and the opportunity for slackening his thirst so small, that he suffered

once an

great mental agonies. And so he came
to Halifax, where he was told, there was
to be found a wonderful chest full of
medicine that
his pain and for ever satisfy his in
would quickly relieve

tellectual thirst.

The ignorant man easily found the
chest, for it was accessible to all. It
was very large, however, and its contents were locked up by night and by
day. There were eight locks of difterent size and quality. Also, any man
who wished to open the chest to make
use of the medicine had to manufacture
his-own keys. . But the ignorant ma»
was very ignorant. He had never seen
a key. So it was only after many,
many days of arduous toil and fatigue
that he learnt the use of a key and
succeeded in manufacturing eight that
would open the intricate and _ oldfashioned locks.

At last, one autumn day, he opened

unlabelled bottles: large and small and
of every colour. As he was going to

noticed an inscription on the cover of
the chest. His hopes sank as he
read these words:

‘‘Beware using the medicine in
these bottles without knowing

Others, spiritual poison causing a slow
and painful mental death. The contents of some will give you new life and

But no such man could be found in
the land, so the ignorant one, having
gone thus far, thought he would at
least taste a little of this and that
medicine, to see if he might not be
cured, Afver four long years, however,
he left the chest of learning in despair,

The freshette was perhaps the least

or a person with buck teeth,—“Both,”’
she claims, “get in the way.” Two
sophomores agree that a line is necessary but it must be subtle. One of the
law students, (there are only four), dislikes an escort who doesn’t know that
he should get off the tram first or that
he should conduct her, in the absence
of a waiter ore usher, to a restaurant

Education Defined

Here seems to be the definition of
education for the week: ‘‘The inculcation of the incomprehensible into
the ignorant by the incompetent.”
This whimsicality is from the pen of a
British physicist. Student and instructor are alike stung by the barbs
of the wit. The allusion has no
standing, we feel sure, at Dalhousie.

Britain has for a long time sent
her able speakers to the shores of
the United States to help the Americans to realize their ‘‘duty’’ to the
world in regard to peace. For some
reason the personages of the Government of Downing Street saw no point
in grasping the utterance as soon as
it was made for index of a new policy
in the United States. Perhaps if
Italy, Germany or Russia had been
the aggressor a reply would have
been soon forthcoming in glowing
terms. Regional ‘duty’ remains as
the guiding spirit of international
encounters, this would indicate.

One could not get away with such
a rollicking satire in many another
country.

“The Constitution’ says a caricatured Chief Justice Hughes with
arin thrown in the air ‘‘Has been found
unconstitutional.”

WHY NOT?

_ That compulsory, or, better, required physical training can
be successful at Dalhousie is demonstrated by the fact that at
the present time ail Freshmen with the exception of special students
are taking classes in physical drill from Sven Korning, our instructor. This means that ninety freshmen are now turning out

twice a week and are enjoying the unquestioned advantages of

_ Danish calisthenics to body and mind.

2 Freshettes, too, are not being neglected this year. About
forty girls now meet twice a week under the capable direction of
Miss Wray, physical instructress. In short education at Dalhousie
is coming to mean more than simply book-lore—“‘Body and Mind”

_ is replacing “‘mind’’—and why not?

 

THE DALHOUSIE REVIEW

The October issue of The Dalhousie Review has just been
released and we wish to draw the students’ attention to the high
calibre of the articles in this, the latest edition.

In suggesting articles of particular interest to the Student
Body we point out that one which is written by an undergraduate
of this University. “Population Shifts in the Maritimes’’ is
significant of the fact that Dalhousie students are capable of
producing items of sufficiently high quality to merit their inclusion
in as noted a periodical as the Dalhousie Review.

We feel, also, that “Early Struggles of Dalhousie College”’

‘should be read by all Dalhousians, past and present as it brings
a light the trials and tribulations of this University and its early

ays.

The book has a wide variety of interesting subjects and touches
on many matters of general interest. “Topics of the Day”’ should
be read by all,‘as much can be learned from a perusal of this article.

Two short poems are included to add novelty and brightness to

the issue. |

college which in spite of modern fads
for teaching such things as child psychology, teaches the use of the ablative,
the aoerist, and the gems of Latin and
Greek in the original. — Its value lies in
the completeness of death. Men may

and fall, our civilization may be destroyed from want of good economists
and psychologists, but the classics
will go on forever.

Music at Dal

To return to a matter of more immediate interest to the student body:
Can anyone explain the possible prejudice against a musical organization of some sort around the campus.
Music is not a strictly new conception
if it is being held off for that reason.
I do not mean an extension of the
glee club activities, although I can
think of no objection to that either,
but I should like to see something af
Studley that would create the absent
opportunity to hear music as well as
to make it. No one, it appears, nowadays objects to canned music, and very

Did you ever sit and stop to think,
And sort of wonder why,
When vacation days are over
And Dalhousie days draw nigh,
Why it is your heart beats faster
As you bid your friends goodbyeAnd at the eager smile that lights your

Do you sort of wonder why?

At the University of Western Ontario, a psychological examination is
held for all freshmen. ‘It is not an
intelligence test,’’ says the university
‘Gazette,’ ‘‘for such records are obtained from high school examination
records’ This examination is merely to discover the pupil’s aptitude for
the vocation which he has chosen, and
to give a different slant on the records
already possessed by the office. The
results of the examination are to be
available to the professors only if a
student has made very low marks.
Presumably it will enable the profesor
to know if the student concerned is

to my mind, its place is definitely
not at one’s entrance to an university,
but rather several years before. If a
student does not know why he is
coming to college, and a great many do
not know, then he should not be there.
Lack of purpose is probably the single
factor most decried by student leaders
on all Canadian campuses today.

Well, men, the Shirreff Hall dance

bid at this early date has some sinister
purpose behind it. (For girls only:
don’t you think it was a mean and
despicable trick for them to hold

sprightly hop?).

 

_ Will the mercenary creature who
suggested that Shirreff Hall institute
special week-end rates for osculatory
exchanges at the rate of thirty per
quarter, please explain just what he
considers ‘“‘special’’ in those rates?
Does he realize what that would
amount to in the course of a week-end?

 

“And if I promise to love you always,

will you take me to the Shirreff Hall
dance?”” To think that one of our
worldly wise seniors fell for a line like
that.

When a man is christened with a
name like Harry Lauder, it is to be expected that he will be continually on
the watch out for practical jokers.
This one isn’t. Being a freshman, and
seeing a notice on the wall to call a
certain number, he did so. It was the
chief of police. We are told that all
the chief said was, ‘‘That’s all right,
I understand perfectly.”” Another
freshman fell for the same gag, and
called the undertaker, asking if there
was a box there for him.

Pete Nicholson and Doug McKean

their childish enthusiasm for fire crackers. Doug was certainly wet when he

the vandals certainly messed the hallways. Typical Sophomore technique.

MEETING FOR THE BOOKS

There has always been a sneaking
suspicion that a few members of this
outfit were more than a slight bit
wacky. The meeting held Saturday
noon strengthened that suspicion.
However, in all fairness, it should be
admitted that history was made there,

the minutes of a previous meeting were

enough incidents occurred to

treasurer’s report showed that the
greater part of the dues were being
paid on the penny installment plan
but nevertheless the fight as to what
was to be done if and when the dues
were paid went on. The suggestions
were many. Bob ‘Stachowski’’ Wallick went highbrow and wanted to buy a
library. The twins—Becker and Kronley Ltd.,—came in with an estimate ona

fashioned smoker. The whole thing
was let slide till a future date. The
meeting was adjourned by motion of

and have lunch. Result—no decision,

“The beneficial effects of gymnastics

The Meds pushed the Frosh out of
the Interfaculty Rugby league race by
handing them a 12-0 defeat at noon on
Saturday and put themselves in a
three way tie for first place. It was the
experienced Med team’s gamie from the
very first and though the Frosh fought
hard they could not avoid the shut
out. Hazen Mitchell was the individual star of the contest scoring five
points for Medicine within five minutes
of the opening whistle. :

Arts and Science took a hard fought
game from Law by a 6-3 margin also
on Saturday. The Lawyers made it a
real battle all the way but the Studley
men had just enough power to earn
their win. Roberts and Rowlings-each
got an unconverted try for Arts and
Science and Pooh DeWolfe galloped
over the line to chalk up the Lawyer’s
three points.

Law soundly trounced the Frosh
15 by the lopsided count of 19-6 at
Studley on Sat.Oct. 23. In the first half
the Law machine blanketed the first
year men and pushed over five tries,
two of which were converted, to score
all their 19 points. After the interval
the Fresh turned the tables and held
the lawvers scoreless but were only
able to gather in one un-converted try
and a penalty kick to make up their
6 points.

In the second game on Saturday
Medicine and Engineers battled to a
scoreless draw in a listless game.
Neither team played their best rugby
and borh muffed good scoring chances.
The Med scrum had a decided edge
on the Engineers front liners but vicious
tackling and many miscues prevented
the Med backs from taking advantage
of their chances,

Soball Plans

A meeting of the soft-ball managers
for each faculty was called on Tuesday
to make arrangements for this year's
edition of the Interfaculty softbail
league. Interfaculty manager Ed.
Cragg felt quite hurt when nobody
showed up but went right ahead and
made a few plans all by himself. He
stated to the Gazette that the league
will be conducted along the same general lines as last year and will get
under way early this month, in fact
as soOn as arrangements can be completed. He recommends that the

Yes, I was the guy who picked Dal

us on a few of the selections but just
how many. Well, wait and see.

A word of explanation. With regerd
to the fullback position, it must be
remembered that Victor Haines demonstrated early in the season that he was
the man for the job—but Haines was
forced out early in the season with
injuries. Our modest pal K. Smith
although undoubtedly One of the
best players in City League football
must be moved up ‘o his regular position on the line. Haley of Acadia
in his two appearances piayed heads
up ball but falters in the speed department. Therefore to Geo. Clarke we
award the honors.

Astotheline, Joudrey, K. Smithand
Don Bauld because of their steady
piay throughout the year command
the first three berths. As to the
fourth there’s a long toss between
Ted Crease, Don MacGregor, Henry
Ross, Graham Runnells and a few
more. We chose Runnells and have
nothing more to say about it.

Strangely enough the block half
position presented the real hurdle
in picking the above team. Neither
of the three teams possessed an aut
standing man in this position. Johnny
Just was steady. Charlie Thomas
was awful but when moved into a

forward berth proved to be a whirlwind.
To tell you the truth we can’t remember
the Acadia block. But do you remember Burpee Balcom in the block assignment last year. Why Coach Kelly
didn’t use Balcom is beyond us, so we
now nomiiiate him for the job.

Stump Mont and Charlie Ryde
take the picking and flying assignments without dispute.

Tomorrow Dalhousie will move to

Reds Defeat Dal

A battered pack of Tigers dropped
their last City League engagement
with the Wanderers 14-0 on Saturday
afternoon at Redland. Before a meager
crowd of fans the ancient rivals staged
the most spectacular game of the
season, the final score being no indication of the play. Led by that fighting
bunch of forwards who have played
good rugby all year the Bengals carried
the game to the Kedmen all the way
through and the final whistle found
them still battering away at the Red’s
goal line.

Dal started away fast and made
several dangerous sorties into Red
territory in the first few minutes, but

could not pierce the air tight defence
thrown up by the Redmen. Wanderers scored their first points when they
were awarded a penalty deep in the
corner. Miller made it good from
the difficult angle. The Dal backs
were tackling hard and often and
made several nice runs, but did not
break into the scoring column. Wanderers added three more points when
they were awarded two penalties in
quick succession. Andy Duffus missed
the first but Miller made the second
from an easy angle. The half ended
6-0 without either line being crossed.

The second half produced some
spectacular play but Dal were held
scoreless while the Redmen took advantage of every break to push over
two tries. Ross and Chernin made
nice gains on running plays and there
was some very effective punting even
against the stiff breeze blowing down
the field. Smith at fullback made
several beautiful recoveries but
Reds could not be denied indefinitely
and before the end Joudrey went
over for two tries one of which Duffus
converted.

Clubmen
were

dribbles but the confident
fought off every threat
rewarded with a shutout.
