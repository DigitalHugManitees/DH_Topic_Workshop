Kirkeonnell’s announcement, relayed to the President
of the Students’ Council by
Dr. Kerr, means that there
will be no Acadia pilgrimage
for the first time in many
years. Devotee of the annual
outing will have to wait until
next year.

The position as it stands at the
moment is that the Dalhousie senior rugby Tigers are in first place
in the City League, a position they
will share with Acadia if the latter defeat Navy. There will thus
probably be a playoff later in the
season between the Dal and Acadia teams, whether at Acadia or
in Halifax is not known.

Also affected by the forfeiture
are a ‘soccer game and the intermediate rugby game.

IT'S YOUR ORGANIZATION!

In browsing through recent exchange papers from other
Canadian universities we came upon an editorial in The
Carleton, which discussed the merits of the National Federation of Canadian University Students, more popularly
known as NFCUS.

; It seems the Student Council of Carleton College were
undecided as to whether their University should become a
member of this organization.

This editorial made us realize that too few students are
aware of the purpose, function, and accomplishments of
NFCUS and we write the following in the hope that it will
acquaint the student body with an organization that has constantly acted on behalf of Canadian university students.

“The ideal of NFCUS,” said Gordon Gwynne-Timothy,
past National President of NFCUS, “is to represent ALL
Canadian students as a group—exactly what the name implies. The Federation is not concerned with vague generalities
about student government; it is rather interested in finding
practical answers to the question, “What can a national organization do about problems that are common to all students ? Nor is it merely a selfish university group; its wider
aim is to promote better understanding within Canada by
bringing about closer relations between students of all parts
of the country”.

Well, what has NFCUS done? Just this.

Those train fares you students buy at the end of the
mid-term—you know the ones that cost you one and onethird fare, rather than the full price of a round trip ticket—
that was NFCUS.

The dramas produced by the Glee clubs of various universities are obtained at reduced royalties through the efforts of the Federation. This reduction in price also refers
to the purchase of sports equipment.

And we mustn’t forget the seven students who have
benefited from exchange scholarships. It might well have
been you.

. “But,” says Mr. Gwynne-Timothy, “much greater justification for NFCUS is to be found in its plans for the immediate future.” .

1. Reduced summer plane fares to England, and train
fare reductions the whole year round.

2. Special advertising rates for Universities.

3. Reduction of the high cost of books, now under investigation.

4. Sponsoring of an inter-University discussion series
of radio broadcasts. ,

5. Investigation of problems arising from student fees.

This is NFCUS, your obligation. It has done a lot for
you, so give it your full-hearted support.

Letter to the Editors

past. few years considering the
number of students at Dal. As
Dal is the headquarters of the
D.1.D.L. this year, we must make
debating one of the leading activities on the Campus. To do this
we must have the support of every
student, either as a participant or
as an audience member.

- Dear Sirs,

Cheers to the Editors for the
vastly improved editorials in this
_ year’s Gazette, and especially for
_ the one concerning Sodales and the
M.I.D.L. conference, In the past
sports have been given an unduly
large amount of space on the editorial page. We, of Sodales, appreciate the Editors’ attempt to
stimulate interest in debating and
| ~~ publie speaking.. It would be well

to remind the students that all
male members of Dalhousie are
members of Sodales. Too few are
_ taking advantage of the opportuniae ties offered by this Society. The
| --—- Mumber of active members has

been been pitifully small in’ the

Once again, congratulations on
this year’s editorials. They show
a positive attitude toward and give
constructive criticism of failings at
home as well as those of other universities, a self examination which

should benefit Dal.
i
Yours truly,

C. M. GRAHAM, ©

Wednesday, October 26 Li Up
early, and to the counting house
where I did exchange for notes the

coin gathered in my stocking,
which I keep under my mattress.
The scholars at Dullhousie have
planned a full week-end, and I am
resolved to attend every function,
at a great drain on my purse.
They do intend to hold two great
Balls Friday night, and thence off
to the home of the “Appleknockers” where there will be a joust,
which they do call the “grand auld
gaime”. At the house, I did fall
into company with one Gab N.
Read, who did complain most vociferously on the cost of the coming
days, and informed me of his intention to return to the graces of
his father, since-he does feel a new
love for him.

Thence to Marmalade Hovel, on
an urgent errand. The great
beauty, Miss Loose Scalp, did send
me a note pressing me to help her
restore her reputation. It seems
that this fine young lady and her
companion, one Holy Spitting, have
been charged with keeping a room
that is disorderly. I did tell Miss
Cutit of the Hovel how fine were
the deeds of these two, and on my
word she did excuse them.

Feeling uncomfortably virtuous
then to a lecture conducted by a
pedagogue of spirit, Burning Martini, who did rant on for a great
while about one Will Shanksbare,
a bard of notable proportions both
physical and mental. The voice of
the pedagogue being extremely
loud I did take an early departure
owing to a troublesome sickness
termed by the French mal de tete.
So home to my wife who has become of late very obnoxious. I did
berate her soundly for her practice
of imbibing wine before bed, and
then to bed.

Thursday, October 27—My wife
having left the bed early for the
purpose of replenishing the larder
I did sleep till noon. Thence to
the Lady Hamilton where I overheard the bar wench, Morgue Metaltown by name who did speak
foolishly concerning me, and claiming me to be an inmate of Marmalade Hovel.

Before returning home, to the
apothecary shop for a new preparation from the colonies called
Sen-Sen, a most miraculous wifedeceiver following a visit to the
inn,

Friday, October 28—Did attenda
meeting of the scholars of Studlee,
at which many fine scholars were
nominated to high office, and some
not so fine. They did conduct the
meeting with the acne of politeness, all being loath to take office,
thinking others to be better. When
all but four in the meeting had
been nominated, they did decide
that those remaining were naturally the best, and now Olhairbrush
Panty, the best of the lot although
he cannot spell, is their leader.

Leaving the meeting, I did journey to the great meeting hall of
the scholars, wherein I did see
many engaged in erecting seats.
And in the midst was one Wetty
Heavens, telling all and sundry to
leave more space, that her little
friends might play on the floor.

Wearied at the sight of- one
slight female oposing many men, I
turned homeward, meeting on the
way one Goodcough, who did tell
me of an item he inserted in The
Spectator (edrly edition). He did
ask for some lonely lass to correspond with him, that she might
have the unequalled opportunity of
attending the Law scholars’ Ball
with him. Then home, wondering
at the modern woman, that she
does not crave the company of one
such as Goodeough. Later to bed,
decided that woman is pretty wise,
after all.

“Why Stop? We've got
plenty of gas left”

Egbert may be slow to take a hint, but
he hits on all six where money management is concerned. He’s not the guy to
run short of anything either — not even
gas on a quiet country lane, His financial
reserve at “MY BANK” takes care of
that.

E70 A MILLION CAWADIAN

Thousands of students from coast to’
coast are following Egbert’s example.
They're finding how easy it is to lay aside
some of that cash from spare time jobs
in a savings account at the B of M.
They’ré finding, too, that a “fatality
fund” is a big help when an emergency
arises — like that damaged fender or an
unexpected trip with the team. ~*

~ Dent Notes

 

 

This week, we happened to meet
two lady dentists sipping cokes in
the canteen. So we sat down and
had a chat. Of course you all
knew the first one. She’s that gal
with the lusty right arm — Kay
Stack. The additional feminine
gender is in the fourth year with
Kay.

The name is Sylvia Bloom.

Sylvia came to Montreal a year
ago from London, England, and
now calls Montreal her home town.
After a year in Canada she has
almost adapted herself to Canadian
customs and speech, —

In London, she studied Dentistry
and obtained a license. However,
before actually beginning practice,
she obeyed the pioneer instinct and
sailed for the land of Mounted
Police and Indians. Now she is
working for her degree.

Then we asked her some of the
obvious questions: “How do you
ana.”

“Twelve of the clock, and a
sharp, clear night it is. All’s
well!”

“Gentlemen, I am afraid that I
a ° . .
must bring an end to this polished

and gracious evening of learned
debate. It’s gone twelve, and my

closing time is long past.”
“Thanks for your kindness, Will.
That was an excellent dish of tea.
Yes, most excellent. Well, gentlemen, to hell with Wordsworth.
Let’s get back to heaven,”

K.G.F.

other city I’ve seen in Canada.”
The tourist association boys would
love her.

How about Dental

Training ?
Well, she marvelled at the amount
of attention given each student,—
“Exceptionally well. looked after”
she put it. As to the technical
side, she feels that the modern
equipment, méthod and __laborsaving devices are much better
than those in her previous training,
and, “makes for a much more satisfying result.”

Sylvia came to ‘the school and
fitted into the picture_so quietly
that no one felt that she was a
newcomer.

So this is an official welcome
from everyone, and a wish for good
luck too.

The Ball is this week, isn’t it? I
needs must save my strength.

Dalhousie hats should be all doffed to football player Bobby Wilson, a real athlete, full of Dal spirit and with plenty of what it takes.
Towards the end of last season the stalwart backfielder received a serious knee injury, but refused to let a little thing like two torn cartileges
keep him out of action. The result was the medics telling him, that he
would never lug another pigskin. However, after an operation he was
allowed to try and although wariness of his injured kneeler affected his
play he has now regained his confidence, In our opinion he starred in
the last two contests and we look for big things from Wilson in Dal’s
attempt for the play-offs.

No one seems to know what has become of the trip to play the
University of New Brunswick. This game should be played this
season, at all costs, if we expect to get a Maritime College league
any in operation. If the snores emanating from the D.A.A.C. office
are any indication, there will be no trip and no effort made to
effect it. a NS '

Joe Smallwood, the head Newfie, was in town last week and was
credited with the prize statement of the month. A noted advocate of

As everyone has noticed, Sammy Peeps has been resurrected, but it looks as though he has gone on the wagon. Last year,
Sam consumed at least two bottles of sack per column—we have
reason to suspect that so did its author, Jackson DDT Lusher, now
toiling for the Halifax Daily Fence Sitter.

We wonder if the D.A.A.C. are going to have an athletic banquet
this year. Probably not but they should. Last year, the “D” awards
were handed out by equipment manager O’Brien in a dark corner of
the store room, surrounded by a large group of athletic supporters.

Last Monday night saw the annual initiation of the freshettes at

The Dalhousie Tigers moved
into a first place tie with the Acadia Axemen by virtue of their 8-0
win over Navy, at Wanderers Park
last Wednesday afternoon. Bill
“Foo” Grant and Eric Kinsman,
two Law students, were the big
boys for Dal each scoring a try.
‘Rod Morrison booted the last two
points for the Gold and Black after
the second try rounding out the
scoring.
U Wanderer’s Park was turned into
- a sea of mud by a steady downpour
of rain. The ball was slippery and
the play made difficult. It was
because of this that the score was
kept down, and many fine plays
washed out. _
- The first half of the game show‘ed every indication that the game
would end in a scoreless tie. Neither of the teams could manage to
accomplish much. Most of the
play took place in center field as
neither of the opposing teams
could push within their opponents
20 yd, line.
Late in the second half, the
_ Tigers put up a sustained drive
_ pushing deep into Navy territory.
On the Navy 10, Dalhousie was
awarded a free kick. Gordie Mc_ Coy, playing standoff, shortkicked

_ Unfortunately the interfac game was late and at 1:35 the varsity
arrived at King’s. As they stepped on the grounds the angry form of
Russ Lownds, the rat-tat-tat-boom-boom-boom football writer and

What followed was the worst display of boorishness that members of
a Dalhousie football team have been subjected to on the campus.

Lownds refused to listen to the explanations of Mr. Vitalone who
had a discussion with Professor Dysart previously and was assured that
in a matter of Dal using the field for ten or fifteen minutes extra, an
agreement could be reached. Every time the coach made an effort to
explain he was rudely interrupted by Lownds who ended up by turning
his back on Vitalone and stalking off. True, he invited our coach inside
to see Professor Dysart but not with any display of politeness.

do object to is that a man, doubtless appointed to his position by the
collegé, does not realize his responsibilities to that appointing organization in the continuance of good relations, and by such displays of
boorishness is allowed to endanger the relations between our two uni-versities. Let’s hope that it’s the last time such an incident will occur.
Granted, the footballers were not in the right, but for any man, Dal or
King’s, to behave in such manner is unpardonable.

Navy, in trying to get off a kick,
set up Dal’s final try. When Beer
tried to kick, a momentary delay
caused his boot to be blocked. The
ball bounced crazily over the Navy
goal-line and “Foo” Grant pounced
on the ball for the final try of the
game. Rod Morrison kicked the
convert giving Dal the 8-0 win.

Jim Cruikshanks and Gordie McCoy played an outstanding game

In 9-0 Decision

In a hard fought Intermediate
League game played Wednesday at
Redman’s park the N.S. Tech squad
prolonged their winning streak as
they took the measure of the Dal
Intermediates by a 9-0 score.

The more experienced Tech
team, unscored on so far this season, had a big weight advantage
over the Cubs, but the Dal scrum,
led by Jardine and Kerr, actually
outheeled the Engineers.

Cochrane, Grayston and Johnny

stood out for the losers who

SQUAD IN 49-31 VICTORY

Dalhousie’s Intermediate basketball squad opened the

new season with a decisive 49 to 31 victory over

the Dal

Grads at the Dalhousie Gymnasium last night. The game was
a fast-moving crowd pleaser, a thrill riding on every shot.
The Dal Pensioners set up a zone defence but were no match

for the smooth-passing Bengals.

The score at the half was

22 to 18 with the collegians leading. The Grads were out-.

pleased with the display of his proteges and that pessimistic

attitude is gone.

The half started out slowly with Gorham of the Grads

scoring on a foul.

There are enough players

up four complete teams, plus several substitutes.

Two games were played. The
first tilt saw the “Sehmoos”, captained by Betty Petrie, eke out a
18-11 victory over Gerry Grant’s
“Atomettes”. It was a fast game,
with the “Atomettes” holding the
lead for the first three quarters,
and the “Schmoos” coming up
from behind to win the game.

In the second game the “Swish”
captained by Marilyn ~MclIntyre,
met Barb Quigley and her “Skunk

play was quite well balanced, but
the “Swish” had the edge in shooting and took an early lead. The
“Skunk Hollowites” put up a good
fight but the final score was 23-13
for the “Swish”, This was a fast
game and a bit rougher in spots
than the opener.

Dal out in front and the Black and
Gold never lost the lead. With 15
seconds left in the half two successive baskets by Mahon increased the lead to 22 to 18. The opening half was highlighted by MacDonald’s and McCoy’s_ shooting
and the brilliant guarding of Andy
MacKay.

As the second stanza opened
both teams were obviously settling
down. “Chuck” Connely who during
the first half missed scoring on
several ocasions broke loose. With
McCoy feeding “Chuck” the Dal
lead increased to 380-20. Both
backboards were under the control
of the Tigers. The netting under
the basket was kept swishing by
the eagle eyes of Connelly, McCoy,
Morrison and Mahon. The game
ended with the score Dal Intermediates 49, Dal Grads 31.

Fouling was heavy throughout
the game. The Grads were awarded 13° and made 7 of them good.
The Tigers took 19 though only
made 9 count.

ACADIA FORFEIT
GIVES DAL LEAD

The cancellation and forfeit, by
Acadia, of the games scheduled for
Saturday, gives Dal Varsity sole
possession of first place in the
Senior Rugby League.

However, the members of both
teams were keenly disappointed at
the news. The boys would have

been on the short end of the bet
ting in both contests, due to previous losses to Acadia, but have been
training hard and were determined
to emerge victorious. A sudden
death playoff for the Senior title
will be necessary if Acadia beats
Navy.
