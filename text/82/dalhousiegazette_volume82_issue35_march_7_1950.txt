President, and Zwicker was nominated by the Arts and Science
Society.

The Vice-Presidential race was
very close and a recount of the
votes was made necessary, as
Kinsman received a majority of
only 8 votes over Andy MacKay on
the first counting. After a’‘recount
of the ballots during which the
eligibility of several disputed ballots was discussed at length by the
Committee, Mr, Kinsman had received a majority of six votes over
his opponent; the result being 472
for MacKay and 466 for Kinsman.

The vote for President of DAAC
was a tie, necessitating a re-election, which will probably be held
on Monday. After a recount of the
ballots there were 333 votes each
for Paul Lee and Don Kerr. Gordon MacCoy was elected VicePresident of DAAC.

A re-election will be held to determine the second Engineering
representative on the Council.
Kolm was elected as one of the
representatives but Pavia and
Haley tied for second representative.

As one of the Arts and Science
candidates was disqualified on technical grounds by the Student Council, an election for this post will
also be held, probably on Monday.

STUDENT ADVISERS

During the past few years Dalhousie University, as
well as most Canadian and American Universities, has
grown in student registration in greater proportions
than the growth of faculties. Consequently many students may pass through a university with little personal
contact with professors in their departments. A result
of this is that many students fail to obtain advice which
would make their courses more profitable.

It is recognized that over-worked registrars and
faculty members simply have not the time to devote
to all students, and generally time is given to the few
students who take most interest in the respective
courses. A further consequence of this is that occasional
students are side-tracked int ocourses in which they
students are side-tracked into courses in which they
and on some occasions the lack of interest in such
courses causes a corresponding lack of results.

This could easily be averted if an organization of
student advisers were formed on the campus, preferably
under the guidance of a faculty member. This organization should consist of senior and graduate students who
are willing to give time and advice to freshmen and
sophomore students. The advisers should be chosen by
faculty members for each department. This system has
worked well in many other universities, and we suggest
that the university administration consider its application to Dalhousie.

INTER-UNIVERSITY DRAMA FESTIVAL

Last Saturday night, the Dalhousie Glee Club, along
with the dramatic societies of Acadia and Mount Allison
Universities, presented the first Inter-University Drama
Festival. From the viewpoint of quality, the outcome
was excellent.

Student participation at Dalhousie was not commensurate with the display. That is, of course, understandable for the first attempt, but it is to be hoped that
greater attention will be paid to the Festival in future.

The idea may well be the first step in breaking
down the antagonism which has existed for too long
among Maritime universities. The cooperation during
the Festival was excellent, and in dramatics, at least,
that cooperation promises to produce ever-increasing

 

 

 

quality.
| Letters To The Editor
Editor, Loving, Temperate, God-wearing,

Dalhousie Gazette Simple family folk whose sole in
In reading your Mock Parliament
report in the issue of Feb. 24 I see
that your writer reports that I
made a motion to have Cape Breton made a national shrine “for
reasons beyond this writers comprehension.”

I should like to amplify that
“colorful” reporting to clarify the

position of that dynamic new
party which I represent, the
M.R.P.

His biased treatment can only
mean two things; he has never
been to Cape Breton; and what is
worse, he is not a Cape Bretoner.
Had he listened to the report, which
I meant to give in Gaelic, he would
have learned why such a step for
Cape Breton’s furtherance was one
of urgent national importance.

For him then, and the readers
he has misguided, I should like to
point out why Cape Breton

“SHOULD be made a_ national
shrine.

According to a recent issue of
the Dominion Bureau of Statistics,
the island’s crime-free reputation
makes its crime rate lower than
any island of comparative size in
the world (this includes P.E.I.).
The people of Cape Breton have
been known for years as Peace

terests are the welfare of Canada
and the Millionaires. Since the
days of Cabot this fair isle has
been first on the tongues of Canadians, Here is beauty primeval,
here are mystic glens, here are
Shaggy crags, here, indeed, is
beauty unbounded! Here were
produced such giants in Canadian
annals as Angus McAskill, and
James D. Gillis, the famous Cape
Breton raconteur. Who has really
lived who has not watched the
moon come up over the slag dump,
who can deny this true beauty as
seen from a vantage point between
two oil tanks on the lower Esplanade? This paper’s yearly quota of
newsprint could not contain THE
wondrous tales of Cape Breton.

For these few, enough alone,
and many other reasons Cape Breton should be made a _ national
shrine. If your Yeporter is still
not convinced, Mr. Leo MacIntyre
will hold consultations on the issue
from 3 - 5 p.m. daily in, the Law
Common Room,

As James D. Gillis once wrote in
worldly vein, “I have been to Boston twice, I do not say it as a
boast”, so I would suggest nest |
humbly that it takes greatness to |

Dear Sir:—

There is a sad, sad situation on
the Dalhousie Campus. A great
pall of gloom hangs over us . ..
student apathy, that terrible ogre
which consumes all before it. So
what! As far as this modest writer
can see student activities are at a
higher and better level than they
have ever been in the boom postwar years, certainly better than in
the past four years. And we’ve
had a smaller enrollment and a decreased budget in 49-50. Let’s look
the field over before we gripe:

Athletics — Interfac. sports are

flourishing as in former years and_

competition is keener under the
new point system which is to find
the all-round interface champion.
Varsity sports naturally have their

ups and downs depending upon the|
material in any given year. If this |

was a poor year for the Canadian
Football Team, it is certainly a
banner season for the Basketball
Tigers. Again, so what!

D.G.D.S. — The Glee Club’s two

major presentations of 1950 were |

above the standard of the previous
three years, particularly the production of Othello. Certainly there
was no backward trend here.

Pharos—Anything is better than |

the 48-49 fiasco (this is not passing any opinion on the ridiculous
argument of who was or was not
a bad boy) We will have to wait

iand see the end result of Pharos

for ’50.
Gazette — (Perhaps this writer is

| biased, but news and sports cover|age and certain other departments

were very efficient this year, better’ than in the previous two seasons Our features, or supposed
‘literary’ page has left much to be
desired but this condition can be
easily remedied for the future.
What more do you want? More
student participation? Who’s kidding! Only about 5% of any student body is ever active. If anyone ever disturbed the other 95%
revglution might result. Let the
2% continue to martyr themselves.
This writer conceitedly considers
himself one of the martyred and
enjoys it immensely. Perhaps it’s
a privilege to be one of the few
who knew and is interested in
what goes on around him. Dalhousie (the 5% that is) is in for
another good year in 1950-51,
though the decrease expected in en
'rollment may increase difficulties

of finance, If anyone is particularly worried about student apathy,
don’t Just join some organization
or other and drown your sorrows in
work.
Sincerely,
H.A.,

see whether or not candidates
could be run. Assured of the financial basis by secretary Jess Wentzell the members then went on to
nominate Bill O’Hara (Queens 749)
to run as president of the Students’ Council, and Eric Kinsman
(Acadia ’48) to run as vice-president. The nominees for the position of Law representative are
Jim Palmer, and Ian Robertson.

Xx dike Ta Tice 52-35, Force
E Play-off for Intercollegiate Crown

The St. F.X. cagers came roaring back into the Nova
Scotia Intercollegiate basketball picture Saturday night as

they took a 52-35 victory over the league-leading Dal Tigers.

The Xaverian win ties up the two teams at the top of the
heap with three victories and one loss apiece.

First reports had the play-off taking the form of a two
game total score series starting on the Dal floor on Thursday

evening.

However, as the Gazette goes to press, there is a

possibility that a sudden-death game will be played on a neutral floor to decide the Nova Scotia Intercollegiate cham
_pionship, and the right to meet U.N.B. for the Maritime title.

Both squads played a tight man-@————____
to-man defence during the game,
but more accurate shooting and a
tighter defence paid off for the
winners. Once again the big man
for the Xaverians was Rudy Pace,
former Sydney Academy stalwart,
who racked up an even dozen
points. Conley with 11, MacNeill
with 10, and Propper with 9 points,
were also outstanding for the
X-Men. Mahon and Henderson,
both with 7, and Connelly with 6
points, led the Dal attack. Referees Alf and Snowdon Johnston
called a total of 18 fouls, 12 of
them against St. F.X.

Pat Conley scored from the tipoff and from then on the X-Men
were never headed. They led by a
93-16 score at half time, and, during the second half, five consecutive baskets gave them a 44-22
lead. In the final 10 minutes the
Bengals surged back but couldn’t
cope with the deadly set-shots of
the X-Men.

In the final game of the Intercollegiate Hockey schedule played
before the basketball encounter,
the Xaverians, as expected, once
more emerged triumphant. The
X-Men finished their four game

' schedule, during which they were

unbeaten, with a 12-4 win over the
Black and Gold, and now advance
to the tri-province finals against
the U.N.B. pucksters.

The Xaverians displayed a well
balanced, all-round team. They
play a fast, driving game, complete with the best in sportsmanship, and should be a sure-in for
Maritime honors.

As far as the Dalhousians were
concerned, the star was once again
net-minder Bill Janes who stopped
a total of 50 shots. The first line
of Morrison-Smith-Jardine scored
all the Dal goals, with Morrison
and Smith each racking up two.

Dal Racqueteers
Again Take Title

For the 5th consecutive year the
Dalhousie Varsity Badminton team
has copped the Maritime Intercollegiate championships. Played this
year at Mount Allison University,
the Dalhousians amassed a total in
men’s and women’s events of 22
points out of a possible 30. U.N.B.
came second with 12 and Mt. A.
third with 11.

In the team championships the
Dal women’s team again set the
pace winning in all three of their
events.

In the second day of the meet the
open tournament was run off. This
tournament is an individual affair
based on the elimination system.
Again Dal swept the field, winning
every event but the men’s doubles
which event has been won by
U.N.B. for the last five years.
The outstanding play of the entire
tournament was turned in by Ned
Banks of Dal and Jim Strickland
of U.N.B. in the men’s singles
open. Banks, playing the best
badminton of his career, outlasted
Strickland (15-12) (15-12), In the
final game at 13-12, Strickland
extended Banks to eleven rallies
before weakening.

In the men’s doubles open,
Strickland and Pat Ryan of U.N.B.

Playoff Tonight

Tonight at 8.30 the Dal Tigers,
Halifax Intermediate champs, will
meet the Yarmouth hoopsters in
the third round of the Nova Scotia
play-offs.

The Tigers, who won 14 straight
games in Intermediate competition before dropping one play-off
contest to Acadia, eliminated the
Navy squad in the Halifax league
finals and bested Acadia in a
home-and-home series last week.

Several former Dal stars are currently performing with the Yarmouthians.

‘tossing in a set shot.
put in a foul throw, then Mt. A.
‘followed up with two long shots
;and a free-shot and the quarter

 

ball title. This was the second
game of a total point series. Dal
won the first game by a one sided
score and Friday’s game ended
29-21 for the home team.

The game was more evenly balanced that that played in Sackville
last week. Mount A. had little
chance of making up their 29 point
deficit, but they put up a game
fight.

Gay Esdale opened the scoring
for Dal in the first few minutes
of play with a very nice hook-shot.
Marilyn MacIntyre followed up
quickly with a set shot to put the
home squad ahead 4-0. Erm
Thompson, of the Mounties soon
put them in the scoring picture,
Gay Esdale

ended 7-5 for Mt. A.

The second quarter scoring was
started by Thompson, but Betty
“Cuz” Cousins and Marg “Foo”
Grant put in 2 set shots. “Foo’s”
was on a very nice sleeper-play.
Mount A, came through with a foul
throw and two set shots and Marilyn MacIntyre put in a free throw
for Dal. The first half finished up
11-11. The Dal passing in this half
wasn’t all that it could have been.
There was a lot of bunching up.
The Dal guards put up an excellent fight and their floor play was
really tops Gay Esdale was a bit
loose on her passing but her shooting made up for it. Betty Merrick
and Gerry Grant are showing up
very well.

“Cuz” started the second-halfscoring with a foul throw. The
Mounties followed up with 4
pts. Gay put in five points in quick
succession and 3/4 time saw Dal
with a one-point lead. Dal dominated the scoring in the last quarter
and the final count was 29-21, This
made the total score for the series
66-29 for Dal.

In the second half Dal, although
not so good on the rebounds, was
far superior on the floor play. The
zone defence kept the Mounties
scoring down.

Betty Petrie and Jean MacLeod
turned in really fine games. All of
the forwards put in good games
with Marilyn MacIntyre showing
her usual fighting spirit. Marilyn
and Gay led the scoring parade.
For the visitors Thompson was top
point getter.
