Great Success

Campus comment shows that the
Dalhousie Quarter Hour on the Air
is fast finding favor with Dalhousie
Catering, as it does, to a
very heterogeneous audience the programs almost necessarily have been
mixed, musical and informative. Four
broadcasts have been presented
date depicting for the most part a
cross-section of student life and opinion
—the opinions being expressed through
the medium of interviews.

The radio committee have attempted
to get as many students as possible
before the mike and a survey finds
that six Arts students and four Lawyers
have taken part in interviews while
the greater percentage of singers

Doctors are right on their heels.
Those most responsible for the preparation of musical numbers are Rudd
Hattie, Wilf Boothroyd, Marion Geldert, Fran Gardner, and Mary Marsh.

Dalhousie Medical Journal
Presents Excellent Issue

This week the medical students
and graduates of Dalhousie received
the first 1937 issue of the Dalhousie
Medical Journal, and judging by the
comments, everyone was very well
pleased. This is the first number
produced by the new staff under the
editorship of Chester B. Stewart,
and it compares quite favorably with
previous issues.

The Journal has had only a short
life as compared with some Dalhousie
institutions, but it is forging vigorously
ahead to take its place among the
important and permanent College organizations. It was hoped on _ its
introduction last year that the Journal
would serve as an extra link between
graduates and the Medical School,
and this aim is being fulfilled. The
editors have received letters from
Alumni in various parts of the continent, commending not only the Alumnus News, but also the excellent
articles by both students and faculty.

The present issue contains two
articles by faculty members, Dr. E. G,
Young and Dr. N. H. Gosse. The
former gives a very interesting account of the Tercentenary of Harvard
University. Dr. Gosse tells a very
interesting story of the activities of
the cancer quack, not nearly such a
rare personage today as many think.
The student articles are all of ahigh
order as well. Dr. G. A. McCurdy
presents his usual interesting news
items concerning the Alumni, and

Corston, a memorial to our late
Professor of Physiology, Dr. Fraser
Harris.

 

Glee Club

Matching the high standard of
last week’s presentations, on Wed.
10th, the Glee Club will present the
second set of three plays in competition
for the Connolly Shield. The Newman
Club—many times winner—have enter
ed “Old Moore’s Almanac’ directed
by Miss Pauline Corrigan. The next
two are true “dark horses’’ in this
competition—‘The Man in the Bowler
Hat’’ directed for the Department of
Education by Prof. B. A. Fletcher
and Sigma Chi’s “‘The Rehearsal’
under the direction of Ernest Higgins.

As usual, Jerry Naugler and his
orchestra after the plays.

Thurman Speaks

The students of Dalhousie had the
opportunity over the past week-end
of hearing Dr. Howard Thurman,
noted poet, philosopher and educationalist. Dr. Thurman, who spoke
here under the auspices of the Student
Christian Movement, is Professor of
Philosophy and Dean of the Chapel

at Howard University, Washington,
D. C., and a recognized leader ofthe
educational movement among the
negroes.

On Sunday afternoon Dr. Thurman
spoke in the Dalhousie gymnasium on

the “Tragedy of Dull Mindedness’’
in which he outlined various unproductive and unsatisfying attitudes

of life and these he examined in the
light of his penetrating criticism.
The combined ability of a poet, actor
and orator lent to his whole interpretation a unique charm. Having
examined certain philosophies and
found them wanting, Dr. Thurman
proceeded to what he considered the

Dr. Hans Simons, who for six years
occupied the position of director of
the Berlin School of Political Science
and who gave up the post after the
change of government in Germany
delivered an interesting address on the
present condition and future procedure
likely to be adopted by the League
of Nations in his address “A New
Deal for Europe’ at the Dalhousie
gymnasium last evening.

Conditions in Europe have undergone drastic changes since the major
conflict of 1914, stated the former
German professor. At one time it
was possible to travel throughout
all Europe without such hindrances
as identification papers, etc. Today
the scene is entirely changed. European nations question everything from
their own ideals to foreign policies.

Added to this, there are important
external factors which in themselves
are having a serious effect upon the
actions of the. nations in Europe.
Particularly is this true of Great
Britain who with the trend in isolation,
as proposed by some of her Dominions
is faced with a problem of very grave
proportions. This much is realized,
thowever “that Europe must and will
take care and solve her own problems, ’,

iminent danger of war.
Therefore, we the undersigned

Canadian students resolutely affirm
our stand peace and hereby
submit the following petition to the
Canadian Parliament.

1. Whereas the Militia Act is
part of the Revised Statutes of
Canada c. 132, 1927; and,

Whereas certain sections of this
Act make it possible for Canadians
to be conscripted for active service
abroad by order-in-council,

Therefore we hereby register

Whereas the relationship of

A CHALLENGE TO OUR DEMOCRACY

We have sometimes heard it said that the next world war
will be a battle for supremacy between fascism and communism.
On the one hand, the “red’’ calls upon us to join with him against
the great menace of fascism; on the other, the blackshirt, actual
or would-be, attacks the red bogey of communism and summons
us to his support. Each claims that to oppose the other means
to support the first.
. | Surely, however, the solution of this dilemma is plain. Social
at a democrats, democratic socialists, liberal democrats, or whatever
label you wish to paste on supporters of our present British evolu> cay. democracy, must oppose all fancy-shirts of whatever
colour. History has shown often in the past that the man who
1 Meike moderate view balanced between the extremes is usually
ht. We believe that such is the case today. Neither fascist
should gain our support—democracy must stand

ical parties in order to maintain the

Liberal democracy must recognize this foe and fight it. The
weakness of liberal democracy as seen in the history of the past
twenty-five years in Russia, Italy, Germany, Japan, and Spain,
is that it has not recognized the incipient autocratic party until
too late to subdue it. Let us not make that mistake!

THE HOME IMPROVEMENT PLAN

During the past few months we have seen the inception by
the federal government of a far-reaching plan for building new
homes and renovating others throughout the Dominion. Already
this scheme has proved of untold value to hundreds of people of
medium income whose home-loving aspirations have been aided
and to thousands of skilled and unskilled labourers who have
been given work. The government which instituted this plan
is to be highly complimented.

Lest, however, somebody, of either party, should think tha
this step, valuable as it is, will solve the Canadian housing problem
completely and at the same time abolish unemployment, let us
. look for a moment at the probable results of the application of
the scheme. In Canada there are only about 182,194 people

- with incomes of over $1,000 single and over $2,000 married—
this is the class which may reasonably be expected to be able to
improve their homes under the scheme. If we allow to each a

- family of four, it means that at the most 73% of our population
will be able to improve their homes. Our housing problem is
thus by no means solved.

‘a Furthermore, if we take $500 as a living wage for a labourer,
and consider that all the money that may be spent under the new
plan will be spent for labour (a rather absurd premise), it will
be seen that only 9.2% of the 724,284 unemployed (as of last
July) will be given work. This calculation also does not consider
the increasé in unpaid clerical over-time work in the lending
__ institutions which finance the scheme. Almost the only people
_._ who are absolutely assured of a happy result are these lending
institutions, and the companies which manufacture building
products.

DALHOUSIE GAZETTE

BOOK REVIEW - .- 
; THREE WORLDS

‘‘Reading maketh a full man’’—-Bacon

‘‘Three Worlds’; Autobiography,
by Cal Van Doren, 303 pp. New York.
Harper’s. 43.50.

Mr. VanDoren is a_ portentous
figure in modern American literature.
A professor at Columbia University
during the World War ~he entered
journalism immediately afterwards and
as editor of the “Nation”, the “Century” and the ‘Literary Guild’, he
led a life which makes his autobiography an intimate literary chronicle
of the times.”’ It is, however, not
only the autobiography of one of our
leading literary figures, but a book
which deals with a whole period,
depicting as it does changes in custom,
He distills
and crystallizes particular incidents
and gives to us a picture of American
life and letters during the past half
century.

He was, as he tells us, born in a
village called Hope in the American
Mid-West, in 1885, and lived in that
vicinity till he was fifteen. In talking
of his life there he portarys the small
uneventful village in vivid and exciting
terms. A ‘‘microism” he calls it—
complete and self-existent—the background of many great men, and the
backbone of a great nation.

From school he passes to the University of Illinois and there we find
the picture of a mind awakening, of
an ambition stirring, and a concerted
precociousness being squelched. By
a man’s reading you may know him,
and he says of himself while he was
at college: “I read as a_ passionate
experience or not at all....... ” From
that we find the young Carl Van
Doren. He had no motive in his
readings. To him it was a simple
instinct, like falling in love. Most
college students now would rather
fall in love. At Illinois he took his
Bachelor and Master’s Degrees and
then departed for Columbia to take his
Doctor's.

At Columbia he ‘“‘fell into the hespitable backwater of the University

system’, and decided that literature
_ |was his career. He first followed
|this profession as a professor and then

started his Second World as literary
editor of the ‘‘Nation”. |

The first big event of his Second
World was the War. To him it was
more an emotional event than a
physical struggle. He did not go
to war for as he says—‘‘How can |
hate a nation when | have merely
laughed at its bad manners and bad
learning’. His dissertation on the
war itself is very powerful, combining
passion and reason. ‘“‘The war was
epidemic and the epidemic was delirjum.”

As literary editor of the “Nation”
he was fully established in the field
of modern literature. In this book
he publicizes some of the letters he
received from various authors. One
of the most interesting is one he
received from Sinclair Lewis explaining his condition, mentally and physically, before the publication of Main
Street. It is an interesting sidelight
on the greatest figure modern
American Literature.

The author is one of the great
literary critics of his day. In this
work he gives the essence of literary
criticism, and his test for a good book.
He says, “Criticism ordinarily asks
about literature one of three questions:
‘Isit goodé” ‘Isit true?’ ‘Is it beautiful?’ *’ He calls these the three
dimensions of criticism, and in the
same tone adds that there is a fourth
dimension which ‘includes all the
others and im a sense transcends them.”
That fourth dimension is the question:
“Is it alive?” He says that judgment
of all literature may be based on that
query.

Dr. Van Doren gives us a portrait
of Elinor Wylie which is hard to forget.
It is probably the most alive partof
the book, for Miss Wylie was very
much alive. He shows her as a petulant, tragic, beautiful, joyful, and
glowing creature, one almost capable
of showing all those characteristics
at the same time. Mysterious and
unreal at times, her deep and sincere
love for Shelley seemed to be one of
the most real things about her. She
lived with contradiction, was a contradiction herself. Her death was
both tragic and beautiful.

The death of Elinor Wylie may be
said to be the énding of the Second
World, for after it came the Third
World coyering the Boom, Depression
and the Future. He tells of the

growing change in American Literature
—something he feels more than he

‘sees. He does not deal with surface
emotions but how Americans felt
and thought and acted—How they

changed their standards, both moral
and material,

He deals quite thoroughly with
the controversy raging around ‘‘Tobacco Road” (the Main Street of the
1930's, he calls it) and all the while
the reader senses that he is a man
not idly writing, but a man who understands and realizes his subject. As
he sdys, “A man to write on something, must be in love with his subject’’. Such is his case. Van Doren
is conipletely bound up with modern
American literature—a moving figure
n it for three decades. He speaks
with an authority and_ simplicity
which causes one to listen, and fully
believe.

In his final chapter Dr. Van Doren
barely escaped being trite. Unfortunately, for it leaves a somewhat sour
taste. He harps on the old theme
“Courage in the Future!’’, but, fortunately, he does view it originally
and writes on it in the same way, but
he gives the impression of a _playwright with two good acts, and being
sadly in need of a third, rehashes the
first two and tries to present the result
in an original light. It is the one
drawback to an otherwise interesting
and enlightening work. It is a book
which is both a text-book and the
lightest of current stage offerings.

On The Level

Some few weeks ago rumours began
to spread concerning the disgraceful
way in which the Engineering and
Commerce Societies were slingingud m
at each other. If the _ pessimists
at the bottom of these rumours would
only stop and think for a moment,
they would realize that inspiration
is often a result of competition. The
two societies split on the dance,
quarreled about dates, quibbled about
hotels, and as a result both dances
were tremendous successes.

The newly formed Arts and Science
Society has hitherto been functioning
very quietly—so quietly, in fact, that
many of us wonder whether it functions
at all. Just how does the Engineering
Society stand with respect to the
Arts and Science Society? Obviously
any organization must have fees in
order to keep going but we already
pay class fees and society dues. Is
all our money going into the coffers
of societies? In other words, do we
or don’t we pay dues to the Arts and
Science Society in order to have the
privilege of finding out what’s going
on about the campus?

Kemember last fall when the Commerce-Engineers team tied with Medicine for the Interfaculty championship? It was a hard battle and meant
a lot of work for both teams to get
out there. Yet nothing has been
done to solve the difficulty of who
should bear the title. Those interfaculty pins are not to be sneered at.
But where are they? Surely it is
time they were dished out. Probably
they should be awarded to each team.
Certainly it seems that interfaculty
sport could be entered into much more
enthusiastically if the management
was a little more firm and the rewafrd
more certain.

Now at last hockey has got under
way. If you fellow Engineers would
only come out and play hockey (this
means you, Blair) the team should
do pretty well. As it is, in our first
game with Commerce-Dentistry we
finished with a 2-0 win. Good old
Dizzy Dean thinks nothing of catching
the puck in his mouth. However,
we warn all comers to give Bill Scott,
the bad man of the interfaculty league
a wide berth. He just revels in
loosening teeth so that he can take
the hapless victim to the Clinic and
torture him.

One final thought. On Feb. 18,
the engineers are holding their annual
banquet at the Nova Scotian, followed
by supper dance. We wish to remind
all you engineers of the fact, so let’s
have a full house. By the way, did
you notice how closely the Tech boys
copied our dance programs? Glad
to have helped you, Tech.

Much has been said of the vanity

of women.......of the money they
spend in cosmetics, finger waves and
manicures......_ but nothing can rival

the attempts of boys residing in fraternity houses to beautify themselves
prior to having their graduation pictures taken. Particularly do we cite
the cases of Bill Simpson and Wink
Johnston... those two beau Brummels
of masculinity who in an effort to
obtain a wave in their locks drove
poor little Petite de Landreville ‘The
Sigma Chi hairdresser” to distraction

z - What is wrong with Dalhousie?

by an idealistic academic community
_ and consider, if you will, the basic
flaw i in our educational system.

The answer to that initial ever| absorbing question is that Gutenberg
_was born too late or that universities
were founded too early. Since this
is not the annual report of a Browning
Society or one of Professor Bennet’s
mere obscure lectures, an explanation
is herewith appended.

Gutenberg, as every schoolboy and
no college student knows, invented
movable type in 1440, and thus made
possible the printing of books cn a
large scale. Universities existed for
hundreds of years befcre that epochmaking event. The plot now begins
to become inspissated.

Previous to the printing of books,
knowledge was preserved on_ parchment; laboriously handwritten by
_ scribes. It should be clear, even to
--an economics major, that manuscripts
were the products of much tiresome
toil, that few copies of any one work
were available and that their price
was a bit steep, especially to the
eternally impecunious student. The
use of textbooks at mediaeval univer_ sities was, therefore, impracticable.
Consequently a system was devised
which solved the problem in an eminently satisfactory manner. Students
came to listen to lecturers who read
-(“lecturer” is derived from a Latin
S a 2s word meaning ‘‘reader’’) and _ the

_ students thus copied their texts from
+ a dictation. There is the origin of the

a eo modern lecture system.

t ‘a _ an | have made way for their successors.
‘iis Not so, however. The lecture system,
ie - =i for what reason Academic Senates
_ only know, has persisted and universities remain schools of penmanship.
a A Professors are no doubt superior
__—s creatures, but they hardly know much
__ more than can be read in the standard
texts of their subjects. Even if they
do, that is no reason for their dictating

caer What a terrific waste of time and
ae energy it is for a professor to dictate
day after day to a scribbling class
_material which they can read from
3 books better than they can read

rs ie, What an unnecessary addition to
_ the etiology of writer’s cramp!
In many of the undergraduate
_ courses there is some reason for this,
since the students do not buy books.
it But in the professional schools, where
books are bought because they will
be used in later years to earn their
_ Owner's bread and oleomargarine, there
is no excuse for the droning recital
- and mechanical copying of facts which
are waiting upon the student’s bookshelf for his perusal.
Small wonder, then, that the powers
that be in Medicine have found it
necessary to drastically enforce a
former dead letter in the University
_ fegulations—the rule making a definite
jl percentage of attendances a _ prerequisite for writing examinations.
P be The student, who occasionally—very

_ there is a choice between listening
a, ‘to a rehash of what is in his textbooks

_ and observing the gyrations of Miss
_ Eleanor Powell, it would be a pity
if the aforesaid Miss Powell were
_ neglected.

_ original research and of original thought

without the camouflage which hides it,
Or, better still, let them issue mimeographed noted detailing peints which
are not in the texts. Fer the rest,
let them instruct us to read our textbooks. Their duties thus become more
congenial to them and to us. For
instead of boring dictation, classroom
hours will be spent in explaining
difficult or obscure parts of the text,
answering questions, and—this is important—asking questions.

If each classroom period is a potential
oral quiz period the student is constantly kept toeing the mark, It
might be offered as an argument
against this that the strain on the
student’s nervous system in knowing
that he might be called on at any time
would be unbearable. It is, however,
preferable to the strain on his nervous
system on the eve of the sessional
examination when he realizes that
his notes and books are still virgin.
Far better that constant quizzing
keep him alert and that his hazy
conception of the subject be cleared
up in classroom discussions.

Another advantage ef this system,
and by no means a minor one, is that
the importance of the sessional examinations would be lessened. It has
ever been a contention, here at Dalhousie and elsewhere, that it is unfair
to base one’s grade in a course on one
or two examinations. Too many things
can happen to mar the accuracy of
such a measure of the student's knowledge. Through constant classroom
quizzing a more thorough and complete conception of his standing in
the class is obtained and the obvious
unfairness of one great bat is eliminated,

Nor is this hypothetical theorizing
or Utopian dreaming. Dr. Atlee in
his class has made a good start in
this direction. He has eliminated
the formal lecture and dictates only
such material as his personal experience
and wider reading have taught him
and which the texts cannot teach the
student. He has substituted explanations, questions by the student and
oral quizzes for what might have
been a resumé of Eden and Lockyer.
The ideal system is only a further
expansion of the method which is
being used in a classroom of this
university, and no doubt in other
classrooms here of which your reformer
has no personal knowledge.

 

 

In days of yore, (or was it gore?)

(English students read no more!)

Norwegian saga-men would sing

Tales of Iceland's noble king,
Toar!

These tales, I’m told, in language bold

The ancient bards did e’er unfold;

In manner not unlike ‘‘True Story”

They made their sagas good and gory,
They sold!

Since saga-men lived long ago

We little of their heroes know

But Morris in the 19th Cent.

Revived the name of one fine gent,
A noble man:

Sigurd the Volsung was his name,

A man of never-dying fame;

Sigurd of Sigmund was the son,

And Sigmund’s father was a Hun,
(I’ve just begun!)

In days of nineteen thirty-seven

When all’s not what it is in heaven,

In Halifax, once more appears

A saga-man (of tender years!),
Undaunted!

Some say he goes to Dalhousie,
But surely that could never be!
A Dalhousian has never yet
Written in the old Gazette

A Saga!

No! It’s never been attempted

Till this beardless youth was tempted,

Lured by hope of fame and glory
To compose on short a story
Called a Saga!

Sport, you see, is to the saga

What “V”’ is to the Latin saga,

The only common thing I see

Is “S” in Saga,.in Vaga “V"’!
You see! Ah me!

[f you’ll excuse reiteration,

One see's (above) alliteration!

Which brings us back to Saga-men

(This seems enough for my poor pen)
Amen!

ANON.

DO YOU KNOW THAT:

The present premiers of the
three Maritime Provinces are all

Dalhousie graduates?

Dalhousie has had five presidents in ninety-eight years, the
first three of whom were ministers?

 

 

That The Students May Know

Dear Editor:

“Dalhousie Awakens’’—that in my
opinion would have well typified -the
Front Page of Last Week’sissue of the
Gazette. For the first time in memory,
students have been aroused to interest
—yes even to some activity. A topic
which can elicit a response of some
thirty letters from Dalhousie Students
merits our attention. It is for this
reason that your scribe considered
such a column should find
into our College paper.

its way

What has aroused the student body
from their lethargy? Luckily for Dalhousie there has always been within
its gates a handful of students deeply
concerned with the well being of their
Alma Mater. For years they have
struggled on, apparently in vain, to
elicit from their colleagues just that
kind of revival which we saw manifested last week. To the organization
which has finally precipitated this
reawakening goes our sincere thanks.

It’s the Year Book that’s made the
student think! For many years this
publication has made its appearance,
quite unheralded, and obviously taken
for granted. Years ago it was found
necessary to discontinue its edition.
Last year it was revived with questionable success. This year the Council
of Students after much deliberation
has decided to give Dalhousians their
last chance. ‘‘Do they or don’t they
want a Year Book?” With some
reluctancy they had to admit that
Dalhousie Students have not sufficient
interest in their own school that they
could not after spending four
years at this university leave
without any published record of their
own activities, of their fellow graduates
yes, even of the school at which they
spent many happy months.

It was however the contention of

last Dominion Census in 1931, the
Dominion Bureau of Statistics reports
that in every country of the Maritimes
except one the number of abandoned
farms has steadily increased, Even
among those who still farmed there
seemed to be no incentive to improve
their methods. Scientific farming and
modern marketing methods were not
favored save in a few cases. The
farmer was impervious to change.
He was content to just farm in the
old method. His incentive was gone.
Nobody seemed much concerned. The
result of this stares the Martimesi
stark in the face at the present time.
It is estimated by some that annually
these provinces import nearly twenty
million dollars worth of farm produce,
the bulk of which could be grown at
home. But, be it remembered that
this excessive food importation comes
to provinces whose basic industry
is agriculture, and whose soil boasts
a fertility as rich if not richer than
any other in Canada. This is a fine

Dal Hopes Dashed
e “As Wilson Scores

A basket netted by Johnny Wilson
as the final whistle blew, knocked from
the Tigers’ grasp a victory which had
seemed secure a few seconds before
when Duff Stewart had sunk a shot
giving Dal the lead. Thus in the most
spectacular fashion seen in some years
ended a hard dog-fight between Dalhousie and the Dal Grads at the Gym
last night.

Standing toe to toe and matching
basket for basket, both teams turned
in a fine display of defensive ball.
Neither team had a lead of more than
4 points on the other at any time.
Lack of any steady forward line which
ha clicked and some tendencies towards
ral individualism seemed to keep Dal from
a getting any effective shots and on the

. other hand Dal’s stalwart defence of

Cook and MacLeod kept the highly4 reputed Grad forwards quite effectively cooped up.

Captain Doug Crease sparkled on
the Dal forward line with heady basketball, and Duff Stewart was highmy - scorer for Dal, and Simmonds for the

What’s Wrong With Mar.

(Continued from page 5)

and as the population increases very
slowly and in some places decreases
the incentive of establishing branch
industry by Upper Canadian concerns
is thwarted. It is seen then that the
basic industries, agriculture, fishing
and lumbering are in dire plight.
Manufacturing is small and the tendancy is for young men and women
to migrate elsewhere. The last economic commission investigating conditions in Nova Scotia found that by
every test the people were poorer
than in any other part of Canada.
What applies in Nova Scotia is common to New Brunswick and Prince

Exciting Games
Law and Arts and. Science each
added another victory
in Interfaculty Basketball competition
at Dalhousie University yesterday.
The Lawyers triumphed over Medicine
by a score of 25-10 with the finest
exhibition of the hit ‘em hard and
knock ‘em down strategy seen in the
Studley Gymnasium in some time.
Reverting to a brutal and bone-crushing
attack which carried and trampled
the Doctors down to the lowest depths
of obscurity the Lawyers succeeded
in sustaining their no-defeat record.

The Arts and Science victory also
had its spectacular side, the victorious
Artsmen making a rally to eke outa
narrow 18-16 decision.

In the Lawyer-Doctor game the
Lawyers ripped right into the attack
with the opening whistle and with
“Rusty” Baird leading the attack
notched up three field scores before
Medicine could get into action. The
Baird-Connor-Cook line using a long
passing attack carried the brunt of
the offensive aspect of the battle with
Cook annexing 8 points, Baird 7
and Connor 6. The long passes made
for fast play and with the excessive
weight and strength of the Lawmen
the little Doctors had rather rough
treatment.

‘*Pirate’’ MacKeigan together with
Pat Gunter formed the Law defence
and the pair handed out checks, which
would have done credit to a hockey
defenceman.

The Meds with Art Shainhouse
former Senior Tiger star in the fore
although not displaying the same
fight exhibited by the Lawyers gave
a fine, scientific exhibition of ball
handling, Shainhouse, Miller and Harris
with a smooth passing attack sifted
through the Law line up time and
again only to have the tall Law guards
teac the ball from the basket.

handled the game but only with the
greatest difficulty.

Dentistry, with a long list of victories in Interfaculty competition looked good to add Arts and Science to
their list of victims when at the end
of half time the score stood 10-5 in
their favor but a determined and
accurate shooting quintet of Artsmen
made a thrilling comeback to eke
out a narrow 18-16 decision.

Crushing Defeat

Dal 9—Tramways 15

 

Putting up a game fight against
the league-leading Tramways, the Da
hockey team last Tuesday night took
the small end of a 15-9 count. As
usual, the Tigers looked like champions
in the first period, outplaying and
outskating the Powermen at every
turn, only to go gradually to pieces
as the game went on, victims oftheir
own lack of condition and of the
superior experience of their opponents,

Dalhousie forwards turned in what
was in many ways their best performances of the year. As the score
showed however, the defence let them
down, being as useful as the proverbial
sieve, and not turning in anything
like the great game of Saturday at
Mount Allison. Korky Koretsky in
the Dal nets stopped the rubberoid
time and again, to stop the score from
soring into three figures.

Outstanding performances were given
by Buckley, the ‘Little Master’,
who in the brief moments he was on
the ice astounded the spectators, and
by Graham who played his usual fine
game. DeWolfe and Napier also played well. The Dal marksmen were
Napier with three, Graham and DeWolfe with two, and Buckley, Dickey
with one marker apiece.
