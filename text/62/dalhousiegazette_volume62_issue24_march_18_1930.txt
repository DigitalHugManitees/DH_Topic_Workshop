Res idee rl
Dal Law School

The Carswell Company, Limited of
Toronto has recently offered a prize
to consist of books which is to be awarded yearly to the student of the first
year who submits the best essay on a
selected topic. The. object of this
offer is to encourage students in the
Faculty of Law to do some independent
research work and to write on legal
topics. This offer has been accepted
by the University and the prize will
be known as the Carswell Essay Prize.
The Faculty of Law is now requiring
the students of the first year to submit
from time to time throughout the session
short essays on certain problems arising out of the class-room work and
opportunity is given to them to discuss
these essays with the members of the
staff. In January of each year at least
three topics, the treatment of which will
involve exercise reading outside of the
assigned class work, will be announced,
Every student of the first year will be
required as a part of his year’s work to
submit in competition for the prize
an essay of not more than three thousand words, before March 31st on any
one of the assigned topics. It is noteworthy that the donors of this prize
who have been awarding for a number
of years three prizes to the student who
attains the highest standing in the
first, second and third years respectively, have by the offer of this new prize
recognized again the place which Dalhousie Law School has taken and is
taking in the field of legal education in
Canada.

The third on the program will be a
Canadian play—one of the humorous
Merill Dennison, Hart House productions—'‘From their Own Place.” It
is breezy and typical of the great unheroic northland. Miss Isabel MacNeill is directing this play. Fat MacKenzie, Bobby Donahoe and other will
known Glee Club stars are numbered
in the cast.

The last play on the bill is one that
will find its way into the heart of a
Dalhousie audience. ‘Barbara's Wedding’ by Sir James Barries. This is
one of Barrie’s most dear and pleasing
plays. An old colonel is day dreaming
of the little boy and girl who play
around his chair. The first part of

him about the war, and Billy Boy—and

‘In opening the debate for the affirmative, Mr. Nowlan complimented.
Sodaies on its efficiency, and noted with
great satisfaction its progress during

proceeded to impress on the audience
the fact that the argument tonight was
not whether Nova Scotia had progressed or not—that was presupposed.
No government can take all creait for
progress, regardless of its efficiency
but the Rhodes government, he contended, were the main reasons for the
progress of Nova Scotia during the past
five years. He reviewed actions of
his government in redmedying the coal

in 1925. The Rhodes Government

Closed Today

 

This issue will be the final one for the present year.

This term the

Gazette staff have established a precedent in that they have published twenty

four issues altogether.

This is four more than in any previous year and

at is the opinion of the present staff that a bi-weekly publication at Dalhousie

4s necessary and quite practical.

Under the present system viz, a weekly

edition it is impossible to attempt to give all of our activities the comment
which they merit, and in most cases the Gazette contains only an account
of the larger activities of the student body, while those of secondary importance such as the smaller societies only receive mention in very rare

eases.

The Gazette, which ts the official voice of the student body can do a

great deal towards interesting the students in undergraduate activities as

was so clearly exemplified this term

when a record attendance at the the

Acadia-Dalhousie football game resulted from agitation arising in our

paper.

Why not have a bi-weekly publication so that all of our activities

can obtain the publicity which is essential to their development? On many
occasions during the presenin term splendid copy had to be wastebasketed
owing to lack of space, there is no lack of material and the added expense
could be compensated for by the additional advertising carried,

We expect the newly appointed council to give this matter their serious

consideration.

Feature Section has been under the

Murray. It is larger'and funnier than
the famous Feature Section of the 1929
Pharos—further comment would be
unnecessary. ‘‘The Faculty” is the
new section which has been added to
the 1930 Year Book. The Pharos
staff. decided to show profs at play as
well as in the robe of the Senatus
Academicus—and the result, well we'll
allow you to judge for yourself. The
1980 Pharos retains the size and shape
of the 1929 book and is bound in brown

Jeather. ~For-those who were not at

Dalhousie last year we will explain
the choice of the name Pharos forour
College Year Book. The first light
house at Alexandria was named Pharos
and the symbol of the lighthouse was
chosen for Dalhousie’s Year Book as
being a particularly appropriate one
for the College-by-the-Sea. This year
the nautical idea is carried through the
book. The activities of the year are
set forth as the story of an old sailor,
Each section is introduced by its
cartoon set in the centre of a helmwheel. The history of the graduating
class is written as a ship’s log and—
well it would take too long to give any
real idea of the contents of the 1930
Year Book but these are just a few of
the things you'll find. And remember
you pay $2.50 for your book while at
other colleges no larger than Dalhousie
students pay more than three times as
much,

 

Engineering News

Last Friday afternoon the Engineering Society met to elect its officers for
next term. Ken Mahen is to be president and Paul Shepherd, secretarytreasurer. Next year’s executive is
to be managed by David Murray and

affairs during his short stay here.
Miss Crocker, who has debated for
the Junior Class before Sodales audiences on several occasions is one of our
most popular coeds. Mr. Muir is a

him in good stead in the administration
of his new duties,

Sodales Conclude Most Suc
cessful Termin Years.

 

Sodales concluding debate of the
1929-30 season last Thursday brought
to a close probably the most successful
and interesting of years in its long
history. Space does not permit us
here to elaborate on its achievements
—however your copy of PHAROS
1930 will bring you the summary of
this in concise form.

Nine meetings in all were held this
year, four during the fall and five
during the winter. In addition to
these, there were three broadcasts
over C.H.N.S., through the courtesy
of the Extension System. The two
other novel features of the session were
the introduction of debates under
parliamentary procedure and with
graduates participating.

The Junior class has done its share
this year. It won the Bennett Shield
for the second time, supplied the
University with seven of its eight
senior debaters and two out of three
Sodales’ officers.

Three intercollegiate debates wer
engaged in this year, and with much

justifiable pride we look back on two
decisions won,

The Officers of Sodales, who retire
after last night's elections, wish to
thank all those who have assisted this
year. Thanks to the brilliant speakers
who have enlightened us during the
season, thanks to the large and appreciative audiences, thanks to the
Intercollegiate Selection Committee of
Professors who have given much valuable assistance, thanks to all those
who have in any way helped Sodales
with constructive suggestions and ideas,
—and last but by no means the least—
to the Gazette and its Editors, who
have given a very great amount of
space to us who have contributon
almost weekly with advance news and
publicity for our Society. The officers
look back over the year feeling that
they have tried to leave nothing undone in their efforts. Successful or
otherwise,—let those to whom we are
responsible decide.

Cyril J. Greene, Law ’31, named as spares in that order, should the need

arise in the meantime to fill a vacancy.

But they hadn't a jobthere, not any

I had a diploma,
And an M. A. diploma, !
And I took my diplomas to the city

I did want a job there,

And no baby’s job there,

And I looked for a job there ’most

And I went down to Wall Street wher
they hire runner boys.
(Sure, there’s a chance for a trusty

“Have you a partnership- I’m not a

But they hadn’t.a partnership, not

I got a diploma,

I took it in my hand to the city

I was after a job there,

And I looked for a job there 'most

So I went to a place where they sold fine

‘“‘Let me in the firm, I don’t like selling

But they hadn't a job there, not anywhere there,

I had nothing,

It seemed I had nothing,

So I didn’t go down to thecity

So I’m sorry for the wage slaves who sell

Since they don’t like diplomas, not

Easy Marks

Our son's phone call
Will from college inform us
His marks are small,
But his bills are enormous.

 

We sometimes call it stupidity
Since his marks are ‘‘C”

And “D”

And Wr...
And we sometimes call it extravagance
Because his allowance hasn’t a chance.
And we sometimes doubt in our estima
tion, .

If we can call it an education,

But I think we'll humour his whim
Because we are so fond of him.

The Mouthpiece

 

 

Dear Sir:

In a previous issue of your Gazette
you were pleading for the support of
the student body at the basketball
games. On Thursday, March 15th,
the students turned out in a proper
manner.
—in body but not in spirit. The
students were willing to yell but they

    
 
 

 

A cheer leader was present |

High.
(c)

And the dances, shows and teas we miss

Would one iota aid towards future bliss

Obliterate them all and go at once
To study: for real happiness is this.

II
(a)

Into exams we go, not knowing
And out of them we come fear growing

And in and out until this difference

Strikes us
Tis Knowledge, not discernment fashions showing.

(b)

And if the teachings here would only
make us

Learn, learn to think and think to
reason, shake us

And wake us from our all but lethal
sleep

Then Life less prone would be to break
tie. 
(c)

So smash the cup that clouded up
Bright Reason

Especially for this auspicious season

And with professor drain the cup of
Knowledge

Fulfilling this criteria of College.

I Ask You

Dear Gittin’ Goofee I received your
suggestion,

A little Freshette would ask you a
question,

If “Dr. MacOdrum is too fat to fance,

Do you think it is likely he’s after
romance?

For sometimes I feel a burning desire

 

 

1 To be the flame of his heart, a match

to his fire.
Has he got “It” or only appeal,
I'd like him to like me but how does

he feel?
Supposin’ he fell for me would it be
; right
Or does he love once and forget overnight?
What does he act like he’s in love

Roar like a lion, or coo like a dove,

Is the girl on a pedestal—there by his
wish,

Or is it ‘‘Down off your perch you poor
little fish?”’

Dear Gittin Goofee may be I'm vain,

But please give me credit I’m not
quite sane

Sorry I’ve so many troubles to bring,

But surely this cat can look at the king.

meeting of Sodales for the year was the naming of the team selected
by the Intercollegiate Selection
from England and Scotland in October.

Committee recently, to meet the team

has been most extensive,

His debating experience
having led the Intercollegiate Team to Antigonish to meet St. F. X. in 1927; the following year he was the outstanding man on the N.F.C.U.S. coast-to-coast touring debating trio from
the Maritimes; and in 1929, he led the Dal team to St. John’s, Nfid., to
meet the M.C.L.I. He retired this year owing to high pressure of work,
but next fall will be back in the arena refreshed and ready to start the
Sodales year off right—with a victory. Ernie’s home is in Bay Roberts,
Nfdd.; he has attended colleges in Sask., Ont., Nfid., and N. S.; was the
last President of the Arts and Science Society; possessor of a literary
“D.”? All Sodales patrons know his calibre as a speaker—convincing,
decisive, direct, unflinching as a critic.

Bill Jost, former Treas. of ’32 and now Secty-Treas of ’31, in league
with Howse, also retired this year from senior debating due to work.
Came from Sydney in ’28, with a valuable scholarship and good debating
reputation. Accompanied Howse to St. John’s, Nfld., in March 1929,
and made a fine impression on the natives of the Old Colony, both his
seen and unseen audiences. Bill’s selection is another wise one. His
first Sodales appearance this year was made last night in the gym with
Mr. Nowlan.

Hon. D. A. Cameron, leader for tne
regative, agreed with opponent, Mr.
Nowlan, in that the Sodales Society
ought to be congratulated in its progress
but thereafter he ceased to agree with

in a weakened condition and compelled
them to go back to work with a redution instead of an increase in wages.
