Prospects are excellent for two winning debating teams at Dai this winter
with a great abundance of material to
look to, of which Sodales may weil be
proud.

The Munro Room tonight at 7.45
will be the scene of the annual senior
men’s trials, when all aspirants for
tne two Senior 1930 Teams wii speak
Each speaker is allowed seven minutes;
he may speak on EITHER side of ANY
of the resolutions below; and a panel of
five judges will select the two teams
after hearing the evening’s speeches.

INTERCOLLEGIATE TEAM

Sodales’ Intercollegiate deabte tnis
year is against the Univ. of New Brunswick, at Fredericton, late in February
or early in March, The Interco.egiate Committee, Dr. George E. Wiison
(chairman), Dean S. E. Smith, Prof.
Angus L. MacDonaid, Prof. Horace
E. Read, and Prof. C. H. M erce1, selected the subject nearly two months
ago, and it wes immediately submitted
to U. N. B. for their choice of side.
They have thus far taken nearly two
months in deliberation and no letter
or telegram has been able to wrest any
sort of decision from them.

The resolution is: ‘RESOLVED,
THAT IN THE INTERESTS OF

SUPPRESSED.” Only undergraduates are eligible for this team, but
anyone may use the resolution in the

The Gazette takes a great deal of pleasure in announcing the installation of drinking and washing
facilities in the Science Building at Studleyf

A communication from the building maintenance committee stating the fact that this body
during the Christmas vacation has ‘put drinking
fountains in each of the mens toilet rooms, and
also the girls’ room and have in addition put in
paper and towel racks and soap containers—also
cleaned the basement rooms up, painted the doors,
etc.

As you may recall a plea for these facilities was
made through the columns of the Gazette last
fall and the compliance in the fact of the Buildinging committee places the entire student body under an obligation which we sincerely hope will be
carried out.

The committee has acted promptly in this regard and has al o gone to considerable expense in
order that this lono felt want may be eradicated.

Let us, as students, do our part in cooperating
with the authorities in connection with this in.

The Freshmen were hit the hardest

Registrar and Chairman of the Committee on Studies and Attendance is
the busiest and mmost sought after m
in the University at the present time.

Arts and Science Exam inations brought forth many surprises. No examination was particularly complained
of at the time of writing as being too
severe—a.though a great number shied
at Pnilosophy l—and strange to say,
this year, students taking tnat class
complained bitterly of tne Psychology

professor in that subject this year

class “flunked,’’ so between now and
April we expect to see many heads

midnight oil burnt.

We don’t think Chemistry 1 showed
as many unfortunates this year as last
the boys and girls seemed to have

History 20 provided the biggest] _
surprise of the year. “This, which is] ~~
usually looked upon as a “snap”
course, brought forth in its wake a
flock of plucks and no firsts. Perhaps
the exeminer forgets that this class is
composed of a group of pre Meds who
look upon History with the same
appretion of Henry Ford whose famous
“Bunk” Theory made Arcnie Blink.
Apparently these Meds will have to
plug up on their History if they hope
to get into Grade II.

Engineers were flooded with plucks.
The dam burst especially for first and

Waving of Paper and U-Pi-Dee Yell Brings Gathering of Clan
in Montreal.

(Special to the Gazetie by Montreal Correspondent).

Fight Dal Grads proceeded down St. Catherine Street West,
Montreal, at 4.00 o'clock ir the morning, yelling and whooping, and
waving a rare copy of their old college paper, a rag known as the
Gazette. They were taken in charge by Constables Laflamme and
Dolan, but were subsequently released on explaining that they
had just received a copy of their old paper. G. B., a wellknown
Dal man of Class 28, suddenly appeared in Childs with a copy of
the paper. He ran into E. M. and others from the old ‘‘U", who
gave vent to a loud “ONE-TWO-THREE” for Dear Old Dal.
Strange to say, we were joined by five other men who left their _
tables with a rush and yell. Ina short time we had quite anumber

EXAMINATIONS—AND THAT SORT OF THING.

oe In December the Gymnasium was filled with an industrious
host. A thousand students went through a bitter and gruelling
test. Examinations are never very pleasant and in the cold weather
of December when shop windows are filled with good things—when
_ the joyous Christmas spirit is felt on all sides—the student must
go through a period of nerve wrecking torture. To those who
think college is a happy wonderland, of dances, football games,
parties, fraternities and fun as depicted in the 100% all talking,
all collegiate, all propaganda, American movies, we ask of them
to come up to Dalhousie any day this week, since the results of
the examinations are posted, and see the dejected mournful,
black countenances of the youths and lasses who attend our un- versity. And these same victims of the “plucking” profs. will
tell you that college is not a fairyland of fun and social entertainment but rather a hive of industry in which the drones who do

- not work are killed.

DALHOUSIE’S HOCKEY PROBLEM.

We have all been greatly disgusted with Dalhousie’s showing
in the Canadian National Sport during the past few years. Those
of us who remember the days of ‘‘Duke” Mclsaac, ‘‘Bricky”’ Dunn,

_ “Babie’’ Bates and other famous Dalhousie hockey players want

to see Dalhousie stage a come back. Five years ago Dalhousie
had a winning hockey team and whenever the Gold and Black
came on the ice there were 5,000 or more cheering fans to greet
_ them.

es We are now at the beginning of our hockey season. The

Gazette feels that this is the year to bring hockey into its proper

____ place in the university. This year, largely through the splendid

-—s support of our student body we won the City Championship
and great honours in Rugby. Let us do the same in hockey.

ne ” Rick 1930 a hockey year at Dalhousie! The Student Council

ought to show some action immediately in this regard. If pep
lies, a College Band, and cheering squads can help win a rugby

solving the problems have been
ted by the writer after his exten
sive discussion of the gravest of the

co

nditions. His solutions follow:
(1) Stiffen the entrance require
ments, admitting only such students
who are qualified in intelligence and
purpose to profit from a thorough

co

(2)

llege training.
Advance salaries of professors.
(3) Abolish intercollegiate athletics

and foster additional intramural athletics.

and markin

(4) Abolish fraternities,
(5) Avoid duplication of courses,
(6) Reduce free election to a mini
m.

(7) Abolish the traditional unit
system.

(8) Abolish honorary degrees.

By taking these actions, we are led

to believe that the colleges will be
reformed to a perfect standard. The
writer does have some good ideas but

it
in

is unlikely that many of the leadg educators of the country would

agree that he has a perfect solution
for the problems the colleges of the
country are supposed to be facing.

re
co

Most _ educators would probably

agree that by stiffening the entrance

uirements, many difficulties of the
ege could be prevented. And all

Reform

are most likely to agree that anadvance in the salaries of professors
would bring more efficient men into
the college faculty. But when it
comes to the abolition of intercollegiate athletics and fraternities, reducing free election to a minimum, or
abrogating the traditional unit and
marking system and the honorary
degrees, there undoubtedly would be
a great deal of antagonism to his suggestions.

Most sensible leaders in the educational field will agree that the problems of the college today are not as
grave as they have been painted by
these numerous magazine items. We
are of the opinion that a majority of
these stories do not present a true
picture of the colleges. These articles
do not have a great amount of affect
on the average college student but
wrong impressions are often gained
by those persons outside of the college circle. —Ohio State Lantern.

STUDENTS STRIKE.

Marinette, Wis.—(IP)—A one day
walkout of 100 students of the Marinette high schools here resulted in

No, its the Legion for me.! failure recently when Principal W. B.

Senty threatened to end outside ac
WiS€. | tivities if the students stayed away from
school any longer.

The students walked out as a protest against the suspension of three
members of the football team alleged
to have participated in drinking parties.

George Mahon, Adjutant C. O. T. C,
worked hard over the holidays in transfering equipment from the old office in
the basement of the Arts Building to
the new office in the Gymnasium,

 

 

 

Met at Childs.—An unusual chance
meeting took place a few days ago
when four Dalhousians came together
in Cnilds Restaurant in New York.
Miss Margaret Lowe, Warden of
Shirreff Hall happened to walk into
this New York restaurant and was
pleasantly greeted by Miss Frances
Power, Arts ‘24, Jack Power, Science
'29 and John Morton, M. Sc. '29

Murray Kept Busy.— Murray Macneil! has been worked overtime of late
settling the problems of those who
flunked in the past examination.
There seems to have been a great

Saw the freshmen,

Saw them shiv’ring

In tne office;

Saw them standing

In the hallways;

Saw them gaping

At the buildings—

And he wondered

Whence they came.

Senseless instinct ~
That so often
Guides the wand'rings
Of the youthful
First-year student,
He was sorry
For these children
Who are vaguely
Sent to College
To be pawns
Of Todd and Archie;
To be plucked,
And to be partied;
To be loved,
And p’raps to love;
Sent to dance;
Supposed to study
At their French or
At their History;
Learn to smoke.

QH the poor, the
Youthful asses
Who are sent to
Old Dalhousie
To be shaped
Into a something
That will govern

That will lecture

And present us
With a bill, or

We note with pleasure that the

it 1s Canadian. We are more than

Chewing Gum
_ Tragedy

"Though every thoughtful man agrees
That one good way to clear with ease
Your teeth and their intestices
Is by consistent chewing,
"Twill harm you not to muse upon
This history of little John
‘And mark how chewing led him on
And on, to his undoing.

When first on gum he closed: his jaw
The years of John were only four
Or maybe just a trifle more

To be precisely truthful,

And there can be but slight excuse
For parents who would introduce
The chewing-gum tree's tempting juice
To one so very youthful.

For ’lo, without an interlude

Through all the years that then ensued
Young Johnnie chewed and chewed and

_ chewed

With consummate devotion.

And up and down would go his jaws
And ‘round and ‘round without a pause
In flat defiance of the laws

Against perpetual motion,

When one recalls what people say

Of stones, that dripping, wear away;
Or thinks of how each washing day
Reduces mangle rollers,

Tis hardly to be wondered at

As Johnnie went on chewing that

In course of time he levelled flat

His while supply of molars.

In vain his mother shrieked ‘‘My son

Where have you been? What have you
done?”

He wore the rest out one by one

‘Till at the age of twenty;

When e’er his mouth was opened wide

(Or when he yawned at eventide)

You saw no teeth at ail inside

Instead of seeing “plenty.”

Which aught, I think, to prove to you
That if you chew and chew and chew
Your teeth in turn are likely to

Wear gradually gumwards.

And then will follow in a bit
Appendicitis—Think of it.

It always comes when bits of grit

Go cateracting tumwards!

come,

_ Bob. I guess I'll go, but the question is, is anyone coming with me,

George. Bob, old top, don’t be so
assified, no girl is going to call you up
and ask you to go, is she? And, man
alive, it’s free, now we've paid our fees

London—(IP)—Scientific study of

is suggested by E. N. Fallaize, secretary
of the Royal Anthropological Institute.

“From the earliest times,’’ he says,

Letters of a Popular Co-Ed. to her Mater

Now Ma--most of the kids are doing a
lot of talk about plucks since the exams
--but I tell 'em to quit gabbin' and
think of the swell time we're going to
have at the Freshmen's Frolic and the
Med Dance. What bothers me is whether
to wear a long dress and be well dressed
or a short one and give the boys a treat
--But I heard I can get either at

complished in 1929----Ma

(Continued from first page) .

It is just here that an opportunity
is offered to those who have great
wealth at their disposal, and at the
same time realize what marvels can
be done by wealth judiciously applied
in the cause of a truly democratic
higher education. The Carnegie Trustees have set a noble model. Trueto
Andrew Carnegie’s excellent rule, they
help only those who, according to the
measure of their ability, have so far
helped themselves, and are prepared
to help themselves again. It is noticeable tnat this last gitt to Dalhouse is a
capital sum whose interest will meet
each year a part—but only a part—of
the normal deficit on annual expenditure. It is to be held for that purpose. For endowment towards further
advance Dalhousie must depend on
her won exertions and on the help of
other friends as nitherto. With no
assured support from any government,
or any churcn, but making her appeal
on the basis of her proved efficiency
in public service, she must take risks
in the future as she has taken, them
in the past.

Faith in Province.

Finally, to all Nova Scotians, even
those who may have given little thought
to universities in general or to Dalhousie in particular, does not this announcement come as a call to believe
more deeply and more firmly in the
future of their province? ‘This gift
from New York is the taken that
belief in Nova Scotia is cherished by
men of long and practised vision far
away, men accustomed to compare
the promise of one place with that of
another, and to make large decisions
on the result. It has been well said
that every country must be judged by
the strength and the progressive adaption of its educational machinery, because it is this that determines what the
country will yet become. The Carnegie Corporagion nas made more and
more financial ventures on the faith
that for Nova Scotia the best is yet to
be. In this respect it does not stand
alone. On several very different sides,
within these last years, we have seen
a like estimate, both shown and acted
upon by some corporation of great.
power and proved insight abroad
Does not this restore to us a confidence
in ourselves and in our destiny which
for not a few persons—during the lean
year now so nappily past—has begun
to ebb? Surely never was a province
more rapidly and decisively inspired
to new hope than Nova Scotia has
lately been. The door of opportunity
is open. Let’s have the faith and the
courage to enter. i,

a What it Means. ae
But the news, peculiarly gratifying

as it is to all friends of Dalhousie, has
an appeal far wider than the range of
any single institution. Consider what
it means to all, of every college and of
none, who have at heart the cause of
higher education in Eastern Canada,
Everyone recognizes the tremendous
effort commensurate witn the demands
of ‘this new time. Never, probably,
was there a period in our national and
industrial and social history when our
universities required more enlarging
and strengthening and adapting. Necessities never dreamed of by the educators of the past call for immediate
attention. :
How strenuously Dalhousie has tried
to meet this challenge, is obvious to
anyone who remembers her past and
compares it with her present. The
enormous extension in buildings and
material equipment, the founding of
many new departments, the multiplication of the teaching staff, are
points to be noted at once in a walk
through the grounds or by a glance at

increase, relatively to the resources of
any small institution ip these days, is
prohibitive.
A Big Problem.

How to make our colleges equal to
the new demands upon them, without
requiring such fees as no student of
slight or even moderate means can
afford to pay—this is the problem that
has been contemplated by Board of
Governors everywhere with rising alarm
To let higher education become a
monoply of the rich would be untninkable! So almost every college is

proportions which demand immediate

Sir:

interested in debating activities at
Dalhousie I should like to inquire,
through the ‘Gazette," just what
methods are being used in the picking
of a team to represent Dalhousie in the
forthcoming debates.

There are, Sir, certain rumors afloat

“trials” have not yet been held,

and who never heard further concerning it. They are still waiting for their
debate to “come off.”

GOOD MATERIAL,

At present there are nine men in
the University who have in former
years represented Dal in senior conflicts with other colleges or societies
One of them has done so three times,

Ernest M. Howse, B. A., Intercollegiate team vs, St. F. X., 1927.
toured Canada from coast to coast with
other debaters from Acadia and U. N.,
B., 1928, led Dal team in St. John’s,
eis against the M, C. L. I., March,
1929,

Ben R. Guss, B. A., 1927 Inter
collegiate team vs St. F. X. 
Donald G. Grant, 1928 Intercollegiaté vs Acadia.

Arthur S. Pattillo, 1929 team vs
Canadians from Western Provinces.

W. H. Jost, A. Gordon Cooper,
with Howse in Nfld.

Tom D. MacDonald (leader), J.
Louis Dubinsky, Cyril J. Greene,
1929 Intercollegiate team vs King’s.

In addition to these, there is unbounded wealth of material among
the freshmen, which was clearly shown
forth in their class trials—Greenberg,
Picketts, Oland, Squires, Andrews,
Kennedy, Copp and many others.

Sodales urges all those interested
to turn out tonight. It is regrettable
that the trials must take place so early
in the term, but the U. S. men will be
here a month from tonight. Hand
your names in to R. G, Harris, Sack.
4345-W, by 6 p. m. tonight. If you
have not yet prepared a speech it is not
too late!

New material are especially encouraged to enter the trials. No one need
fear the presence of any of these former
debaters. In former years Dal’s great
est hopes have been in her new material.
All are urged to turn out. Many
freshmen and others, will have an equal
or greater chance with some of these
“veterans.”

 

Many Placked.

Continued from page 1

The Freshmen are beseiging Murray
with excuses—the same old gags they
used in High School, but they aren’t
fooling anyone. Murray hasn’t “skipped” 1,297,840 rinks for nothing.
If they try to fool him with an in turn
they're liable to get their railway ticket
home and an out-turn!

Accounting 1 and Economics 1
brought forth the greatest “pluck”
lists for the Commerce Freshmen.

One girl in Philosophy 1 who has won
honours in calsses since coming to Dalhousie couldn’t believe sne was plucked
and demanded a “‘re-count.”

One second year Engineer thought
he was “plowed” in everything but
after finding some mistakes in - the
lists and after talking with a few profs
he managed to pull through with four
passes and tnus saved the day.

Miss Lowe, it 1s said, was not especially surprised, Plucked fresh: ttes
are a necessity it seems and she has
resigned herself to her fate. The
Freshettes did better than usual this
year.

Medicine returns brought a surprise
in the pluck of a prominent popular
musician, the first in his brilliant caree
at the College.

Law Reports weren’t made known
till today although a “fake"’ list to foo.
the first year men was posted yesterne George Crowse was plucked

adly.
