Novel Party

Last Thursday night was the date
set for the novel class party of 381 and 32
The crowd gathered at Sheriff Hall
a few minutes after eight and by means
of a few students’ cars was soon conveyed to Jack Mahar'’s summer home
at Jollimore. The radio was turned
on and everyone started to make whoopee. The floor was fine for dancing
and there was just a good sized crowd
—about thirty couples. The dance
itself was most informal—no programs,
and none of the hurried booking of
dances.

The refreshments were supplied by
the girls and were excellent—not only
that but there was lots of everything
As the evening drew to a close many
voted it the best yet party. Many
thanks are due to Jack Mahar who
made the affair possible; to Prof. and
Mrs. Jim MacDonald, the chaperones,
and to the social committees of which
Drummond Eaton and Alec Nickerson
are the chairmen.

Among those present were:—

The Misses Graham, MacdAuley,
Sandford, Morton, Dorman, Olmstead,
Margeson, Carroll, Williams, Shatford,
Currie, Rossier, MacDonald, Saunderson, Burris, Allen, MacCoubrey, Fraser,

Miss Lowe is Distorted

Girls of Residence indignant regarding alleged

misrepresentation

 

Shirreff Hall.
November 21, 1929.

The Editor of the Gazette.

Dear Sir(

There appeared in the
last issue of the Gazette a
*““Pen Picture’’ portraying
our Warden, Miss Lowe.
The girls of Shirreff Hall
have unanimously decided
that the article is so unfair
that this letter should be
written not alone as a protest but to acquaint those
of our readers who are not
so fortunate as to know
Miss Lowe with the true
personality of our Warden.

The Gazette reaches
many readers who do not
come into contact with
Miss Lowe and we, the
Girls of the Hall, who feel
we are in a position to
know her best, are very
anxious to destroy all false
impressions created by the
aforementioned article. A
clever woman, a fair judge,

a kindly and friendly adviser and helper, a hard and
earnest worker, a charming
hostess and a woman who
possesses a wonderful personality and a modern outlook on all questions such
qualities as these have endeared Miss Lowe to all
women of Dalhousie, who
have lived at Shirreff Hall.

Miss Lowe instituted our
system of self government
and we feel sure that there
there is not a college residence in Canada where the
girls get greater privileges
and fairer treatment.

We do not know the
opinion of the entire studebt body on these ‘‘Pen
Pictures’’ but we feel that
the above facts about our
Warden would more truly
describe her than the series
of played-out jokes that
were published in your
last issue.

Special to the Gazette.—This year
the usual Geology walk to Dartmouth

that will be long remembered by those
fortunate enough to be witness to an
incident that proves that even professors are human. The class followed
the old trail up the track that all former
students know so well until they came
to an extraordinary specimen of the
work or nature. The man with the
hammer in his usual manner asked if
anyone knew what the specimen was.
One of the verdant ones—oh, how
they do love to show their knowledge—
said in an authoritative tone that it was
Iron Oxide. Quite right was the
answer and then the prof went on to
say that it was one of the finest specimens that he had ever seen, etc. Suddenly one of the fathering took a knife
out of his pocket, walked up and
scraped off the paint. It was one of
those moments that some want to

Splendid features planned for 1929-30 edition

The Staff of the 1930 Edition of the
Dalhousie Year Book has come together
cleared the decks and organized its
method of attack. Enthusiasm and
action formed the keynote of the
first Executive Meeting, enthusiasm
to launch the project, action to send
it forward. However, the most zealous
executive in the world cannot do really
good work without whole-hearted support.

Dalhousie has just written another
glowing page in the annals of the
sporting Black and Gold. The Rugby
Teams have annexed both Senior and
Intermediate titles, and they have
done it by hard work. What would
anyone say of a college that let its
Kugby Team go ahead and win mate
after match without support? Supposing no one went to a single match,
suppose not a cheer was given, nor
a single campus-can put into use
in long-distance trips or parades?
Suppose all anybody thought Rugby
was to exclaim: “Oh, how nice! Dalhousie has won the League! Wasn't it
wondertul of us to allow some of our
Council Deposits to do the trick!’’

li you called a university like that
a home for Prigs and Halt-Wits, you
would be paying it a compliment,
Yet many of our own Dalnousians
seem to have this very attitude toward
the Year Book. ‘hey hear faint
rumours of it during the year, they
have nervous prostration if they must
have a picture taken, they pay the kd.
@ great compliment by subscribing
ana then, either congratulate themselves on a wondertully successtul
production, or tear the whole book
to pieces in scorn. In order that the
students can know what is planned,
what is wanted, in what way they can
assist in making the 1980 Year Booka
bigger and better book, the Editor
has authorized a publicity campaign.

This Year Book is to retain the
convenient size made popular by the
book of 1929; the cover design and
colour will be different, the book will
be divided into sections, each treating
of a different phase of college activity,
but these feature sections wu be united
by a continuous thread of thought,
and a common atmosphere that savours
of the tang of the salt sea, Each
teature is to be announced in the
‘‘Gazette,’’ and the co-operation, the
interest, the “rooting spirit’’ of every
single Dalhousiean will be solicited.
lf everyone does his bit, and leands
any ideas ne may have, not only now,
but during the year, (don’t leave it too
late, though!) then a wonderful Book
is assured. As for the name,—what
else could it be but ‘‘Pharos—"’

ADVICE TO UNDERGRADUATES.

| The following editorial, taken from the Montreal Daily Star,

should be of especial interest to many of our undergraduates who

are about to enter a profession.

_~—is Phe: article is a comment on an address given recently to
Cambridge students by the ‘“gloomy’’ Dean Inge of England,
who took for his topic ‘“The Choice of a Profession, and Service.”’

ee oe, DEAN INGE, the stormy petrel of the English Church
~~. has been giving advice to the undergraduates of Cam_ + ~—-‘+bridge University. He elected to do this under cover of
the University sermon, which is delivered on the first
Sunday of each Academical year. There have been
frequent instances of late when the public utterances of
. the Dean have not been received with the enthusinsm
_—— ene might have expected in view of the eminence of the
_ -——s gpeaker. But at Cambridge he appears to have made a
deep impression, and much of what he said has been widely
quoted in England as intended to appeal to a larger
audience than that within the particos of the University
itself.
/ _. The Dean discussed the choice of a profession, and ser| - vice. He told the students that the right work for them
was the work they could do best, which they could enjoy
doing for its own sake. “This,” he said, ‘‘is the main
secret of happiness in life; for in middle life your work
will be your play; and your play merely recreation.”
Now this is a most happy idea, and it is set forth in
terms of well-nigh alluring nature. Moreover, it contains such a substantial measure of truth that it cannot
be brought to the attention of too wide a circle of students
everywhere. There is of course nothing new in the dif_ ficulty the choice of a profession presents tomany. There
is a certain percentage of the students of every university
who go there with a definite goal in view, and of those
there is always a certain percentage again who attain
their goal. But there are, on the other hand, many
who have only a vague idea of what they intend to do
with their lives. It is to these in particulnr that the
Dean evidedtly addressed himself.
So many students, on leaving the university, are at
an idle end. They try this and that and the other form
| of employment, if they have to work for a living, and
_— they wander from pillar to post, content with nothing, and

   
    
 
   
   
    
   
    
     
  
  
  

. making no headway. How much better if, during their
| a. years at the university, they were to strive to find out
what it is they would like best to do and which they can

best enjoy doing for its own sake. They would become
re better citizens better men, and better servants of the State.
ce ee Doubtless many could be induced to do so if they were

» advised upon entering the university of the desirability

f.
Ey Pee OF this, and if the idea were kept vividly before them by
-—s«s:«sconstant reminders from their professors. It may be

none of the duty of a Varsity professor to indulge in such
reminders, but he would certainly be doing his class an
honor, an invaluable, service if he would assume it.
; raha And the University would be of preater value to the

By DR. CHARLES MORSE
Editor ‘‘Canadian Bar Review ’’

 

Dalhousie Law School.—tThe appointment of a new Dean of the Faculty of Law of Dalhousie University
affords a fitting opportunity for a brief
survey of the history, achievements
and promise of this distinguished institution. Sidney Earle Smith, M. A.,
LL.B., himself a graduate of Dalhousie
Law . chool and a former member of
its staff after a period of noteworthy
service at the Osgoode Hall Law School,
to assume the Deanship and one may
confidently expect that under his
guidance its traditions and development will be preserved and continued.

The Faculty was established in 1883.
Richard C, Weldon was appointed to
the Chair of Constitutional and International Law, endowed by George
Munro, and became Dean of the
Faculty. Benjamin Russell  (afterwards a Judge of the Supreme Court of
Nova Scotia) becdme Professor of
Contracts and six leaders of the Bench
and Bar were appointed lecturers.
The Honourable J. S. D. Thompson,
then of the Supreme Court and later
to become Minister of Justice and
Prime Minister of Canada, graced this
strong staff as lecturer on Procedure
and Evidence. Weldon and Russell so
continued until 1914 and 1921, respectively, and it was their devoted and
long continued labour which chiefly
contributed towards the steady growth
of the School. Incidentally they laid
the foundation of the tradition of public
service which has always been characteristic of the School and its graduates,
for both Dean Weldon and Professor
Russel served as members of Parliament. It is due, no doubt, in large
part to their inspiration and example
that from the School have come Judges
of the Supreme Court of Canada, a
Prime Minister of Canada, two Ministers and two Deputy Ministers of
Justice, a Speaker of the House of
Commons, five Dominion Cabinet
Ministers, numerous Provincial Premiers and Ministers and Justices of
the superior Courts of the various
Provinces.

All Canadian.

The School has never been narrowly
provincial for it has drawn its students
from all parts of the Dominion, Newfoundland and the West Indies, and
it has sought to give thorough instruction in all basic subjects without undue
emphasis on the minutiae of practice
in any one jurisdiction. Its instruction
and atmosphere have been liberalizing
rather than strictly technical. This,
in part, is due to the fact that it isa
university law school and its students
have had the advantage of contact
with the various broadening influences
which university life implies. Moreover the students have had and have the
benefit of close intimacy with the
active members of the Bench and Bar
many of whom have served and are
serving as volunteer lecturers.

Fortunate in Leaders.

The School has been fortunate in its
leaders. Upon the retirement of Dean
R. C. Weldon in 1914, Dr. Donald
Alexander MacRae became Dean. No
appointment has even been better
justified by its results. Dean MacRae
admirably built on the foundations so
well laid and kept the institution in the
forefront of Canadian Law Schools,
He made marked contributions to the
development of legal education in Canada generally, and as Chairman of th
Legal Education Committee of the
Canadian Bar Association was largely
responsible for the formulation and
adoption of the standard curriculum,
and the raising of the pre-requisites
for admission to the study of law to
two years of an Arts Course. It may
be observed that, in fact, Dalhousie
had already preceded the other law
schools in Canada in substantially
adopting these measures, Of Dr. MacRae as an inspiring lecturer and the
source of a formative influence upon
the characters of his students too
much cannot be said; he exercised the
influence of a wise father towards his
boys.

Upon Dean MacRae's translation
to the Osgoode Hall Law School a
successor was found in the person of
John E. Read, a Rhodes Scholar and
a man trained both at Oxford and at
Columbia, who wrought zealously for
the promotion of the school and whose
knowledge and brilliancy has resulted
in his recent appointment as Legal
Adviser to the Department of External
Affairs of the Dominion.

Enough has been said perhaps to
justify the conclusion that Dalhousie
Law School has worthily sustained its
reputation as a school wherein is to be
obtained a sound legal education amid
liberalizing influences which aim at
producing men trained in the law, who
are something more than mere technicians with capacity for successful careers
in the legal profession, in commercial
life and in the public service.

The Present Staff.

The present staff consists, besides
the Dean, of two experienced full time
teachers: Angus L. MacDonald, S.J.D.
(Harvard), and MHorace E. Read,

Dean Weldon

 

RICHARD C. WELDON

‘* The Grand Old Man of the
Law School.’’

LL.M. (Harvard), both of whom are
also graduates of the School. Nine
members of the Bench and Bar lecture
regularly on as many subjects, while
five others give courses on special
subjects, such as Legal Ethics, Probate
and Divorce Practice, not covered in
the ordinary course.

Well Equipped.

The library—which is the workshop
of any Law School—is much more than
adequate for purposes of ordinary
instruction, containing as it does more
than 10,000 volumes of reports and
text books with a selection of English,
American and Canadian periodicals
and a unique collection of books on
Legal History and Jurisprudence presented by the Honourable R. B. Bennett, a distinguihsed alumnus,

The Faculty and the Nova Scotia
Barristers’ Society work in close harmony, and in return for an arrangement whereby the Society appoints a
co-examiner in each subject of examination, it exempts from its prefessional
examinations holders of the Dalhousie
degree in law and thereby graduates
are enabled to be called to the Bar
without furtner examination,

The students supplement their tormal
studies by active participation in
moot courts and a mock parliament
wherein they are able to familiarize
themselves with formal court and
parliamentary procedure. They are
also enabled by attendance at civil
and criminal trials, and upon arguments
before the Supreme Court en bane,
to observe the actual pratice of the
foresic side of the profession. Apart
rom these matters, they are enabled
to concentrate on their studies without
the distraction of service in a solicitor's
office during the term, as it is thought
that better results can be secured thereby.
"it is expected that in the near future
a fourth full-time lecturer will be secured, and with a corresponding decrease
in the individual teaching load the
faculty will be able in a greater degree
to engage in scholarly research and to
contribute to the literature of the law
and the develop ment of teaching methods;

Finally, the student is encouraged
to gain as much as possible of his legal
education by his own effort. The
mportance of this is as cleraly recognized today by the present faculty
as it was in 1883 when on the occaion
of the inauguaration of the Law School
the Honourable Adams G. Archibald
said: “The education which the school
will afford, will not of course make a
lawyer, avy more than an ordinary
education at college will make a scholar.
But it will afford an admir ble preparation for legal pursuits. As regards
all education, it may be satd in the
language of Gibbon, that, ‘ very man
who rises above the common level,
receives two educations, the first from
his instructors—the second, the most
personal and important, from himself,’ ”’,

law students to ask that those whose
duty it is to keep the bells in the
Forrest Building in order, arouse the mselves from the state of permanent
coma into which they seem to have
fallen, and do something.

On our boards are spread not ces
from time to time which bear the aweinspiring nomenclature of “Engineer
in Charge of Grounds.” Would it be
too much to inquire whether the said
Engineer’s duties terminate at the
grounds? Apparently they do. Certainly they have not extended to the
bells.

On the Law School side of the
Forrest Building, mounted on the
under side of the stairs, ascending to
the Law Library is a bell. (This is
for the information of those in charge,
or they have apparently forgotten

‘3 whereabouts).

Anyway, the situation amounts to
this. For the last month that bell
has not been functioning; not a squeak,
yip or jangle. It reposes, clinging
tenaciously to the under side of the
stairs, an object of silence—complete
and abysmal silenc>. he only other
beli is located over if the main_nall
and so far removed from the Law
School that it can barely be heard there.

The result quite confusing. A
professor being unable to hear any
bell which should indicate the end of a
lecture, (and no person can expect a
professor to conduct a lecture with a
watch in one hand and a‘ book in the
other), doe; not dism ss the class very
often until is is pas: the time for the
next one to begin. This is no fault of
the professor whatever a d this most
undesirable staie of affairs could be
avoided if those whose duties extend
to the bells would discard that paralyzing lethargy which seems to have
enmeshed their useful activities—and
get busy—and do something!!

The situation referred to has not
cccurred once or twice; but practically
every day, a class is dismissed late,
and the confusion resulting is a source
of irriataion, both to professors and
to students.

In due fairness to the professor of
the Law School and to the students
as well, would it be too much to ask

is

that as this season of the year when
Xmas is approaching and bells should
be pealing, that the hitherto much

neglected Law bell be put into operation and kept that way?

In the Law School our facilities are
not always all that could be desired;
as for instance our lighting system
sheds very feeble illumination, and
our benches are not always too comfortable, yet we try not to c mplain
too much, But, we feel entitled to
have these same facilities working as
well as they will. Let’s have some
action please!

Girls Sport Spirit

The Girls’ Ground Hockey team has
completed its schedule for the year.
It was a great disappointment that
there were no outside games played
this season, but since the team will be
practically intact next year, the practices this term will serve in good stead
There are five more games to be played
in the Inter-Class Basketabll Series.
It is important that the girls wishing
to place in the League teams after
Christmas come out regularly, because
it is hoped that the teams will be picked
before the New Year. There are three
League teams—the Intercollegiate, and
two City teams.

Fencing has aroused a lot of interest
—there have been nearly a dozen turn
out for it. The hours set for fencing are
on Monday, Wednesday and Friday
from 3.30 to 4.30,

The ‘“‘just-before-Exams” spirit is
beginning to pervade the realms of
sport and pleasure.

 

Keen Interest
in Badminton

 

Interest in badminton has increased
immensely in the past two years.
Only last night I went into the gy.
nasium and found all four courts in
use and more players waiting for two of
them. Two years ago anyoné who
suggested badminton was classed as
a moron ora milk-sop. It was excused
in Prof. Mercer because of his tennis
and his position but for a student it was
almost impossible. ‘Two reasons made
it thus, first public opinion and second,
and this is most important lack of
equipment. I think that the only
things we possessed in the line of
equipment two years ago were four
ragged rotten nets and a few miserable
rackets.

Skirts

 

It seems according to the view of the
Paris creators of Fashion that the
short skirt is doomed to a quick and
sure death. The present tendency is
from knee skirts to ankle skirts. This
trend of fashion has taken the fairer
sex by surprise. They have now recovered from their surprise and are
waging an energetic war against the
long skirt. For a long time while
moralists and others were critizing
modern dress, they quite gladly submitted to the rule of the Paris designer.
This seems to be one occasion when
they are not prepared to submit.

There are many arguments for and
against, and it is of great interest to
note what each side has to say.

There are those who say that economically it would be in the best interests of the community. In the past
women have been wearing less and less
clothing and the trade in dress material
had decreased. Cotton goods, was
scarcely in demand, while the silk
trade profitted immensely. The present trend of fashion towards long
dresses would bring about an increase
of trade in cotton goods. Incidentally
many factories will be kept in tommission and many persons will be kept
at work.

There is a small party of moralists
who declare the long dress would
create a greater atmosphere of dignity
—a dignity which the ladies of the
eighteenth century possessed. They

claim that the short skirt is very immodest. It is also a highly immoral
article of wear and has produced a
most devastating effect among the
younger generation.

Those who are against the introduction of the long skirt claim that the
present trend of fashion tends to curb
the athletic freedom which our twentieth century women have just found.
The short skirt is conducive to utmost
athletic freedom. The modern athletic girl is the product of sensible
styles in dress. Further they contend
that woman’s sphere in modern life
is different to that of past centuries.
The long skirt in the days gone by,
might have had some claim to existence. In the present age, it would be
mire a handicap than a help,

They also claim that the beauty
and age of the modern girl will be
affected materially by this new trend of
fashion. This is about the best argument in the whole affair and one which
will carry most weight. “Women are,
after all, daughters of Eve, and they
will naturally keep far away from all
things which will tend to decrease
their attractiveness and increase their
age.

Yet in spite of the fact that the
modern girl is up in arms against this
trend of fashion we find the Paris
creators still adhering to their present
fashion idea.

 

The Sleeper
Wakes

Faint signs of returning consciousness are now being exhibited by that
deadest of Dalhousie institutions, the
MacDonald Library, Last spring the
Library Committee (yes, there is one)
met with a committee of the Board of
Governors and a complete expose was
made of the totally inadequate selection of books provided for the students
by the University. Even that blase
and shock-proof body, the Board of
Governors, was startled by the revelations and it was decided that an increase must be immediately made in
the Library appropriation. The results of this are not yet very apparent
and probably will not be for some years.
One might as well try to fill in the
Grand Canyon with a dump-cart.

Another sign of hope for the future
was seen last week when a blank book

 

.Jappeared on the Library desk, all

nicely ruled for the reception of suggestions of books which should be,
but are not, in the Library. When in
the usual course of events a student
is unable to get a book, he can now
relieve his feelings by jotting its name
down in the hope of shaming the
College into buying it. No great
expectations of action should be raised
by this move of the Librarians but

In my recent travels I took the
opportunity of paying a rather extensive visit to that part of the ancient
world known as Nova Scotia. While
in the country I spent some time in
the historic and once mighty city of
Halifax. While wandering in the outskirts of the city, | came one day upon
a most curious and interesting ruins,
the ruins, evidently of what must have
been once a large and imposing building
My curiosity being aroused, | inquired
carefully of the Haligonians the history
of the building, for I felt sure that
some curious story was connected with
it. But my readers will scarcely believe me when | tell them what I actually found!

It seems that this mighty pile was
once inhabited by a colony of women.
Women alone dwelt within its walls.
Their habits and modes of life will
seem extremely strange to the people
of this age. It is said that these women
lived chiefly for the purpose of eating.
How they survived is a mystery which
the ages have failed to explain. Perhaps they did not. There is some
rumor that their lives after they entered this building lasted only for four
years. When these odd creatures were
not eating they could be seen going
through a series of mysterious contortions to the strains of barbarous
music. They had a shrine, not far
distant from their dwelling, and streams
of devotees could be seen going to
and from it at all hours of the day,
It was known, in their tongue, as the
Li'lstore. We know not yet what
worship went on at this shrine, except
that it was connected with their
practise of eating.

Undoubtedly much information
which I have unearthed of these precivilized women has no foundation in
fact, bu the matter is of great interest,
nevertheless to the inquiring mind of
Man.

The Halifax City League Trophy
will again return to Studley due to the
sensational 5-3 win over the Wanderers
last Saturday.

There also appears to be lettle doubt
in the minds of football followers of
the Maritimes that the McCurdy cup
(emblematic of the Maritime champion
ship) would also be at Dal this year,
if Dal had been able to match her
football ability with Caledonia and

One of the surprises of this year’s
football season was the 10-0 win by
U. N. B. over Caledonia at Truro on
Wednesday—possibly an off day for
“the miners,”

The sport editor of Halifax leading
newspaper declared after the Caledonia
-U. N. B. game at Truro, “that Dal
could easily score a 20 or 30 to 0 victory
over either team,” the game was an
exhibition of how rugby shouldn’t be
played.

Captain George McCleod, who was
out of the championship game due to
an infected finger, was confined to
the “V. G.” for several days. His
many friends are pleased to see him
around once more.

Charlie Jones and Eddie Ross are
still handicapped by injuries received
during the season. Henry Townsend
and Frank Wishart are once again
“rarin’ to go’’ after making a speedy
recovery from various ‘football ills.”

Congratulations are in order for each
and every member of the snappy Intermediate Rugby Team who made
such a fine job of clinching premier
honours in their league.

Much has been said concerning the
various players, but perhaps comparatively few realize the real “secret
of success’ of the Dal team. The
combined efforts on the part of Dr.
Kirk McClellan and Prof, Angus L.
MacDonald who coached the boys
during the long, strenuous season, were
directly responsible for the results the
Tigers obtained. The persistent and
unswerving attempts which these two
men made to round the boys into shape
and give Dal a winning team, cannot
be emphasized too much. It is with
great pride and much pleasure, Dr.
McClellan and Prof. McDonald, that
every member of “the football squad’
says, THANK YOU!!
