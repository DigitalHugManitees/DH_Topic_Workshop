oe.

Capt. Macleod Goes Over in First Five Minutes for

Dalhousie overcame her formidable
adversaries, the Wanderers, in perhaps
the most colourful and most. exciting
rugby game played in the Halifax
City League for many years. _
Completely smothering their ancient
rivals during the first half, the fighting
Tigers succeeded in piling up seven
points, and were successful in sufficiently warding off the frenzied attack of
the red and blacks, to leave the field
with a well-earned 7-6 victory.

A crowd of two thousand and five
hundred wildly excited spectators saw
a pack of hard working, eager Dalhousie

forwards backed up by a fast, efficient

back-field, turn in a game of real football, which was dominated throughout
by “heady” plays. Cae
Dal started out with a bang in the
first half and produced the first real
excitement when, after a few minutes,
of play, Harvie Sutherland, co-operating in a beautiful half line run, missed
a touch by pure hard luck. The
Tigers keyed up by this play, pressed
even harder and their determined efforts
success when

best game of the year plunged over the

line for the touch which brought the

Dal supporters to their feet with wild
enthusiasm. Hardly had the cheering
died away when Kenzie McNeil,
playing his first senior rugby game for
Dal, kicked the prettiest field goal
witnessed in Halifax since the days
of “Tim” Timothy and Ritchie McCoy.
The kick came without the least warning and so shocked the spectators that
it was some moments before the
majority of those present realized that
the score stood 7-0 in favour of the
good old Tigers, From then to the
close of the period Dal continued to
trample over the ‘‘Reds,’’ who seemed
completely at a loss to understand
just why they were at the short end
of such an overwhelming score, just a
few seconds before the whistle sounded
the end of the first half, Wanderers
were awarded a free kick,and collected
three points on a beautiful effort by
Harry Edwards, which again put the
result of the game in doubt.

The second half opened with the
Wanderers determined to even the
count, and from the opening whistle
it was a question of whether Dal would
be able to hold off their opponents.
After many pretty rushes by the red
and blacks they eventually went over
the line for three points, but failedto
convert the try. Three minutes later
a much longed for whistle brought to a
c.ose a wonderful rugby game with
Dal leading their opponents 7-6.

From Dal’s “fighting fifteen”’ it is
difficult to choose outstanding men.
Every man on the team turned in a
“peach” of a game, and every man
was essential to obtain the success
achieved. However, Harvie Sutherland, Kenzie McNeil, George McLeod,
and each and every one of the forwards were exceptionally brilliant, but
their efforts would have been of no
avail had it not been for the fine playing
of every member of the team. In
short, the game was won on feam play
and Dal supporters congratulate their
team!

Special mention should be made of
Sina Singer and his band, and the
Dal cheer leaders. No little credit
is due them for Dal’s victory and the
impression they created may best be
shown by the remarks of a visitor to
the city, “They were great and certainly
put the pep in the game!

Archibald MacKellar MacMechan
is the Senior Professor at Dalhousie,
and is proud of the title. Heis worthy
of such honour as is paid to the senior
professor, which is scant enough.

He likes golf, yachting, the Army,
the Navy, reading aloud—especially
Tennyson,—and_ being supercillious.

He has the best reading voice in
Nova Scotia, and the worst golf manners in America.

He came to Dalhousie when he was
twenty-seven years old. He is now
sixty-eight years young. He was born
in Ontario, and secretly considers
himself something of an expatriate.
For years, when a young teacher,
he wore a straw hat even in winter
time. He discarded that in favour
of his present mortar-board,

He was not born with that beard,
but he wears it effectively. It imparts
dignity,
_ Toronto is his university home, but
is best student work was done in post
graduate days at Johns Hopkins.

He never did study in England.
Nobody knows where he got the accent.
His degrees are B. A. (Tor.), Ph. D.
(J. H. U.), LL.D. (Tor.) He is also a
Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada.
His German is excellent. His French
is passable. He reads in other languages. Every Spring he tells all and
sundry, “Mai ist gekommen.’’ And
he has a French quotation for any
occasion.

He detests gum-chewing, college
yells, and the wearing of sweaters.
le nas the greatest contempt for a
certain preaching poetaster, and little
less for a certain preaching philosopher.

He has not got a good sense of money
value. He would buy the Dartmouth
Ferry and place it on the Library
mantle if he could wrest sufficient
money from the Science Library of
German Periodicals. It is said that
ne once bought a necklace for his
charming wife with the money given
him to pay the butcher's bill.

He is liked by most, though few will
admit it. He is not a good clubman,
but he is a good home-man.

His editions of Tennyson and of
Carlyle are standard. His books on
Nova Scotia ships and sailormen enjoy
a continent-wide sale. A Nova Scotian
only by adoption, the province owes
him much.

He is a good friend, but a bad enemy.
Max MacOdrum is his assistant. That
was a wise choice.

Archie is one of the old guard. He
is Homeric, adamant against the inflowing tide of commercialism and
vulgarity.

T WANDERER S Sodales Decides Against Ed
 

INTERFACULTY FOOTBALL

ARTS VS LAW.

Arts smothered Law with a 6-0
score on Tuesday and collected their
first win of the season in a fast, exciting game in which they outclassed
their heavier opponents in practically
every department of the game. The
game was complete with all the thrills
and spills of a big league fixture, and
at no time was slow and listless.

Every member of both teams worked
hard, but Arts got two well deserved
trys which spelt defeat for the
Lawyers, and sent the Arts supporters
away with a feeling of confidence in
their snappy representatives.

Arts excelled in their half line, and
were ably supported by their hardworking forwards.

Law got in some nice half line runs
and had a tower of strength in Harry
Wickwire at fullback.

The next meeting of these teams
should be much closer, as far as the
score is concerned for the lawyers are
quickly rounding into shape and don’t
intend to let Arts blanket them again.

MEDICINE VS ENGINEERS.

Medicine battered their way to
victory in a regular interfaculty fixture
when they defeated Engineers on

Thursday by a 3-0 score. The game
was one of the fastest games played
tnis season and the result clearly shows
that Medicine is a serious contender
for first place in the league.

The first half was keenly fought,
but Medicine jumped into the lead
when Woods plunged over the line for
three points. The try was not converted.

Engineers came back strong in the
second half when they made things
appear serious for the Meds, but with
all their efforts they were unable to
score.

Engineers excelled in their heavy
scrum, while the backfield of the
Meds worked fast and wells, and
proved they know how to handle the
ball.

$e

DENTS VS FRESHMEN.

The Dental football squad, which
made such a strong bid for league
honors last fall were given a severe
set back on Sautrday by the Freshmen
who crossed their line in the second
half for a pretty try which was converted by “Bud” Thompson, star
half liner for the verdants.

The Dentals, altho threatening to
score several times in the opening
session were completly outclassed in
the second stanza. The game ended
5-0.

Newcomers to Pine Hill Undergo
Annual Tortures

“By their haircuts, ye shall know
them.”

As ig always the custom in Pine Hill,
the new residents are heartily welcomed
every year by the seniors.

Each year the mitiations are always
looked forward to by the new students,
with feelings of mingled fear and joy;
This year the initiation being by no
means inferior to those of the past.

At last the night of festival arrtved.
Eager to have the honor of being the
first to undergo the pleasure awaiting them in the ‘Room of Horrors,"
the freshmen vied with each other for
the pole position. *

 

 

With songs of rejoicing the freshmen
paraded to the college building where

the seniors were eagerly awaiting
them.
Harold ‘Puddie’’ Puddister called

the roll and Sheriff Willie Woolner
paraded the poor miscreants forward.
Each face was a character study.
Some with grim determination written
on their brows, to grin and _ bear it.
Others with hope that perhaps they
might be alive when the ordeal was
over. ‘There was as much joy in their
hearts here as a med. prudent has on
taking an oral from R. P. Smith.

However, events moved on—Bill
“Crewso"’ Hampton was the head
electricutioner and to his salutation,
“Have a rest boy,” the freshman gladly
sat down on an easy chair—but alas—
the only easy part to that chair was the
fact that it was much easier to get out
of it than to remain in.

Then the illustrious hair cutters came
and some of the freshmen still won't
believe that the “hopeful’’ wonder had
not brought the family mowing machine
with him. Rapidly the freshmen were

o

transported thru the ropes, the compliments of the different faculties
being given with a will. Good old
salt cod with castor oil dressing from
“Fisheries,” our popular bard, Georgie
Whiteley and Wilfred “Red Grange”
Templeman being the dispensers,

the Meds.—Watson Soders
assisted by E. ‘Flatfeet’’
Taylor in giving delicoius and_invigorating decactious both ‘‘pilula”’
and ‘‘mistura.’’ Each then were carried out and put in supposedly boiling
water but instead they landed in water
as cold as Delta Gamma’s heart, if you
know what I mean. The cries that
arose were significant of the approval
of the recipient.

Then to
being ably

Finally, however, the damages were
repaired and then the second procession
of the night took place.

Refreshments were served, smokes
were passed around, and then after
all had eaten to their hearts content,
Jas. Faye, in a speech full of feeling
welcomed the freshmen to Pine Hill.
Mr. James Fraser, our general Theologue, then gave the official address,
and voiced the sentiments of the
seniors as only James can do. The
freshmen were all introduced individually and after a short entertainment of
singing by the entire mob, a duet by
Bill Hampton and Eric Found, followed
by a descriptive scene by Messrs.
Squires and Horwood, the party broke
up by the rendering of three cheers
for the freshmen by the seniors and
the hearty reciprocation of the freshmen, the initiation ended by the singing
fo ‘For they are Jolly Good Fellows.’
The general feeling being that these
freshmen are the best yet.

vs Acadia,

 

Man® Dalhousians will be shocked
to hear that the faculty is a real menace
to Happiness. While this is ‘the
opinion of many at Xmas time, and
in the Spring, Miss Sadler and Mr.
Guss say that Education at any time,
does not increase Happiness.

Wednesday evening, the 16th, witnessed many eager students at the
Munroe Room. The affirmative was
taken up by Margaret Jubien and

Tom MacDonald, and the negative
upheld by Lillian Sadler and Ben Guss.

Mr. Ernie Howse, president of
Sodales, acted as chairman.

Mr. MacDonald, first speaker for
the affirmative opened the debate.

“Happiness can be conceived only as
compared to something material. We
We do something, or see something
done. If we play football, we must be
educated in the rules of the game
What kind of a game would it be if
we weren't? In watching a game we
must be educated in the rules to appreciate it. Happiness depends on
ability to appreciate, and education
broadens this capacity. There is a
valley filled with uneducated, easy
going men. If they desire to crogs th
mountain, there would be an endless
trip with ox-teams: A man with a
great education makes a railway over
the mountain. Does he not with his
education make them happier? Would
they not enjoy a railway rather than ox
teams?

Miss Sadler was the first speaker
for the negative. Sne said that every
woman’s one hope was to get married.
The woman with a B. A. has less
chance of getting married than less
educated friend, because men don’t
like women with equal or superior intellects. Does it increase one’s happiness to think- No, it is edsier to
rely on other’s ideas. Suicides often
happen asa result of education, The
only thing that keeps us alive are
material tnings. ‘‘Ghank God for
dances, class parties and football.”

Miss Jubien, second speaker of
affirmative said, ‘‘Education is a
physical and social process, extending
from birth to deatn. Education has
taught us to fight smallpoz and other
diseases. Education has taught us
how to live with people. A man deisres happiness for his wife. He learns
a trade, under some greater man than
himself. Thus, education made him
happier. Electricity was founded by
Eddison, other men learned it, through
Education, and so bemefited the world.

Mr. Guss, was the second speaker
of the negative. He said, “If education
made us happy, we would drop business.
From this he led up to the question,
“Do we believe in free will- In the
crisis of life what effect does education
have— We are at the apex of civilization, and education has made =
What has war done— It has made us
lose some of our best bloods.

Mr. Guss, in his rebuttal said that
Education is not a satisfaction of wants.
People trying to get an education have
become weary, and fagged in spirit,
and died. His speech was very clever
and witty.

Mr. MacDonald answered with skill
the arguments of his oponents. He
spoke about the easy going man. Is
he happier with his lack of education,
when he is walking along the street
with his shabbily dressed wife, than
the man, who has succeeded, and is
driving past in a limousine—

A standing vote decided the negative
side winners, namely that Education
does not increase Happiness.

ae THE INTERSCHOLASTIC MEET
It was the privilege of our University on October 11th to have
as her guests over eighty high school students representing all
parts of the province.
The University by sponsoring this interscholastic meeting
accomplished much more than the establishment of several track
and field records. By bringing these young men together on a
University campus where they were warmly received by members
of the student body and faculty alike, they were given the opportunity of gaining first hand information regarding student life
and in many cases a desire for University training was kindled.
Meetings of this kind have a lasting effect and it is hoped that
this year marks the beginning of a long series of such events.

TEMPUS FUGIT

Last year the editors of Pharos, year book of the College by
_ the Sea, struggled hard under difficulties in order to give Dalhousie
an annual of which everyone could be proud. One of their great
handicaps we are told was that the editor and staff were not appoint
ed until farin the term. There was no need for the delay—but it
was just put off from week to week, because nobody cared. After seeing the mistake of delaying the appointment of the editors, the
‘1929 staff drew up a recommendation and submitted it to the
Council. They recommended that the Editor and the Business
- Manager of the Year Book be appointed in the Spring so that
they might start work immediately on arrival back at the college
in the fall. The Council failed to act on this recommendation.
This fall it was further brought to the attention of officers of the
Council that an Editor and Business Manager be appointed hastily,
but at the first meeting of the Council this was not considered an
—suurgent matter and it was put off. Again no-body cared! It is
______ the duty of the Council of the Students to provide an Editor and

a Business Manager for the 1980 Year Book without any further
y. Itis only fair to the graduates of the classes of 1930 that

natter pe immediately taken up by our representatives.

The student body of the University
of Main last year contributed approximately $25,000 to a fund for the
building of the proposed new Alumni
Memorial Gymnasium. This money
was exacted from the students under

igh pressure. All were urged to
“sive until it hurts.’’ Many students
did give beyond their means because
at the time of the campaign enthusiasm
was running high, and it looked as
though work would be started on the
new building this year, at the latest.

Interest in Drama Growing.

Try-outs for the freshman play
“Ralph Roister Doister” will be held
in the Moyse Hall between two and
five o'clock today. Further try-outs
will be held on Tuesday at the same
hours.

The play “Ralph Roister Doister’’
by Nicholas Udall is generally accepted
as the oldest play in the history of the
English Drama. As such it offers the
freshmen an opportunity of learning
the general methods and practices of
the early English Drama. )

Apropos of the Plebiscite.

Contrary to the rabid assertions of
matronly sewing circles and pessimistic
male reformers, the college student of
today is sober ninety-nine one-hundredths of the time. When he does
drink, it is usually to parade his drunkeness—at a football game, at a dance,
during a vacation, at a social gathering
—and it is on such occasions that
shocked older generation is most liable
to see youth in action. False conclusions are natural.

Since the pecuniary element limits
undergraduate liquor consumption from
one angle, and since moral considerations limit it to a certain extent from
another, it is evident that much of the
too-widely scattered ballyhoo about
“the deplorable state of affairs in
American colleges with regard to the
liquor situation”’ is founded upon a basis
of fairly flimsy fact.—The Ulyssey.

Western Ideas are Spreading.

Japenese women in Tokyo are beginning a campaign to ebtain equal
educational facilities with men. Many
Japanese universities admit woemn to
their classrooms as visitors, but they
are not regarded as students and get
no credit or degrees. They are demanding co-education until women
universities become sufficient to take
care of all who would attend.

Another Successful

Freshmen _ Week

Frosh Guardian Makes
Report

 

For the past few weeks, there has
been a certain group of students attending this University, who have
been under constant observation, Every
year different heads of student activities
look forward with great enthusiasm
to the coming of the new students,
for it is from them that they draw
their material and hope to make “‘finds.”’

By this time nearly everyone has
formed an opinion of Class '33, and
at last the.small group of students
have ceased their consultation. Without any suggestion of plotting, it is
now commonly acknowledged that
Dalhousie is more than satisfied with
her new students. They have entered
into college activities with much interest and every society is looking forward to a splendid year strengthened
by the new comers.

Freshman week was a huge success
and by the time college opened Class '33
was well acquainted -with what was
required of them while at Dathousie.
The object of Freshman week was to
introduce them to our college and what
it had to offer. They knew little
about college courses, college activities,
and college life, but after the programme was completed they were wellformed. Addresses were given by
President MacKenzie, Dr. MacMechan,
Profs. McNeil and Murray and all
the different heads of the student
societies. Glee Club did its bit in
providing a splendid nights entertainment and by permitting the new
students to enjoy the social life of
college. “Fat’’ McKenzie put on a
splendid show followed by a short
informal dance. Track and rugby
material was developed immediately
aad is already making a name for Class

Now that freshmen have been initiated and burdened dlwn with much
advice, all that is hoped is that they
carry on in the same good spirit that
has marked their first few weeks.
Everyone is interested and theire is
little doubt but that Dalhousie will
continue to make good with the help
of Class '33.

Buildings

Who says they do not miss us every
ear,

When in the spring we needs must go
away
Why do they seem so solomn and so
drear

And clothe themselves in ivy, far from

gay,

If not because we leave them every
May;

Or since alone in summer they must be

Save for the zephyrs or the suns bright
ray.

I’m sure they whisper to the birdies,
free

Of some poor Freshman’s plight, with
greatest glee.

Then when again the Autumn comes

around

Who says they are not gladened at our
sight,

The rustling ivy gives a joyous sound,

"Tis then they wear their roles that are
most bright

Who says its not for us! It is, all right,

he started for class last Sunday.

Introducing

GEORGE McLEOD

Captain of the Dalhousie Tigers,
Pres, D. A. A. C., Pres. Dental Society,
Pres. Phi Kappa Pi.

To the few not associated with at
least one of the above organizations,
we will attempt to describe this blackhaired youth from the mining town
of New Waterford. The dark hair
was a decided boon to George as he
first saw light in Inverness (near Judique) and later moved to New Waterford. (Credit for the move was lacking when the destination was announc
He found it quite difficult to.adapt
himself to the decided change in landscape, for as you know Waterford
possesses three trees as compared with
the lone spruce occupying one side of
the main drag of Inverness.

Adaptability seems to be his strong
point, however, and of late, rumor
hath it that his feminine associations
are steadily growing, consequently
the name ‘‘Pansy”’ has been substituted
by many for George.

He came to us from Glace Bay High
School and entered the faculty of
Engineering. The yell of that body
however conflicted painfully with his
Philosophy of Life so he decided to
associate himself with the Dentals.

He graduates next spring, (D. V.)

Miller Addresses
Medicals

The Dalhousie Medical Society met
on Wednesday evening in the Health
Centre, with the President, Eddie
Ross, 1n the chair.

Forty-four members of the first year
were proposed for membership and
vouched for by J. T. Smith and Gordon MacKinnon. The first year are
to be congraulated on such a fine representation.

Permission from the Students’ Council to hold the Medical Dance in the
Gym, the first after Christmas has
been obtained. It was decided to
shelve the appointment of the Dance
Committee until a future date.

A proposed change in the byelaws
was also shelyed to be brought up at
the next meeting.

Gordon MacKinnon was appointed
to take orders for the Society emblems,
which may be obtained in the form of
pins, rings or watch-fobs.

The Medical Students Committee
on Studies was appointed, and consists
of the following—Len Miller, Fred
Jennings, Vance Fraser, Gordon MacCurdy and Charley Stewart, one man
from each year. This committee forms
a link between the Faculty and the
students in the matter of student
problems.

A message was sent to Dr. Murdoch
Chisholm at the Queen Hotel conveying the Society's felicitations on the
fiftieth anniversary of his entry into
the medical profession.

Following the completion of business,
Len Miller of the final year gave a
talk on appendicitis. He gave a clear
and concise picture of the condition,
its diagnosis and treatment. His treatment of the subject made it intelligible
to the first year students, who expressed
their appreciation.

The third year Medicals were conspicuous by their absence. It is hoped
that they will have a larger representation at the next meeting.

Marathon Committeemen—The
Interscholastic Track meet committee
established a record when they met in
the Murray Homestead from seven
p. m. until seven a. m. on the eve of the
meet. All members of the committee
are doing as well as can be expected,

THE “‘BOILEMAKERS” BALL,

To quote Al. Jolson—‘'Folks you
ain't seen nothing yet. ‘‘The English
may jar a little, but the phrase certainly describes the dance situation
perfectly. For on Thursday, Noyember 7th (Lucky Seventh), the Engineers will hold their ‘‘Boilermakers”’
Ball of 1929-30.
The big dance is to be at the Lord
Nelson Hotel, and Joe Mills and his:
Seven are to provide the musical
stimulus for five hours sheer enjoyment. The Good-Night Waltz is scheduled to be played as the weather-beaten
minute hand of the old town clock
creeps close to the zenith point and the
equally weather-beaten hour hand
points in the general direction of the
numeral “2”... You'll be up late
tnat night! MindEngineers could remind you of last
term’s “Boilermakers” Ball, but it is |
unnecessary to capitalize on reputation.
For we know that when the bugle
calls—‘‘you'll be there.’’ The bugle
by the way will be Joe’s new trumpet
getting warm on ‘‘Lovable and Sweet.”

An Intercepted Letter

(Contributed)

 

Friday Night.
Dear Mom:—

One-two-three-Upidee. That is the
Dal. yell, and I am practising it all the
time, because a man by the name of
Mr. Mahon (some people call him
Hoot) told us to beget (I think that is
the word) some college spirit by singing
college songs. I am trying to follow
nis advice, but sometimes its pretty
hard, zecause that Freshette in the
next room tells me to, ‘‘Fermey la
bonche.”’

Talking about Freshettes! It’s so
funny, Mom. You know that the
boys here are called Freshmen. And
they look so awful The Sophmores
are making them wear huge pieces of
white cheesecloth over their heard,
with big green ‘‘F’s’’ on the front of
them. Yesterday I was walking with
the cutest Freshman I’ve ever seen,
from the Arts Building to the Murray
Homestead, when suddenly, after looking at a Sophmore, he nodded his head
at me and started running, I thought it
a breach of etiquette, Mom, but found
out later, that all Freshmen have
to run wnile on the campus.

We are going to be initiated on
Saturday. I do hope it won't be
dreadful. One time a girl had to drink
pepper, salt and ginger. Oh, Moms,
and I have a weak stomach, of course,
the ginger might help fix it up!

I was at a “get-together” affair the
other night. They had a new apparatus there. Not a Victrola, but something much larger and louder. Truly
I like our orchestra, with Mary at the
piano and me at the mouth organ,
much better. But some boy played
the piano, once or twice, and it was
lovely. A good time was had by all,
and especially by me.

There is something I cannot com
prehend (Dr. MacFarlane taught me

that word) and I am going to tell you
about it. Tuesday I was walking
across the campus, when I noticed a
man standing by the Science building,
with a hammer in his hand. He was

surrounded by a group of students,
who looked interested in what he was
saying. They tapped the walls, and
then walked over to a pile of rock near
the m. There, the man _ began
breaking rock with his hammer. Someone told me later that this was the
“weekly geology walk,’’ I knew they
taught that in prison, but I didn’t
know that Dal. gave a similar course.

On, Momie, I just got the most awful
shock. Dene and | were sitting here
so quietly, when all of a sudden, the
report of a gun made me jump about
two inches. I wonder if it means
another war! But Dene seems calm,
she looked at her watch and said,
“Righto for once.”

There are street cars here too. The
other night I got on one, and it started
so suddenly that I lost my balance, but
no, I didn’t disgrace your family be
falling down.

Shirreff Hall is lovely. The library
is done in velvet. It has mahogany
furniture, and a wonderful open fireplace. But I can’t understand some
of the girls. The other day I was
standing with a girl when she answered

the phone. She said ‘‘Hello...... It
was just dear of you to call........ Oo
nice to hear your voice again... .etc,

etc,” and the minute she put down
the receiver, “That dumb nut thinking I wanted to talk to nim.’ Isn't
that funny, Mom- :

It was such fun the day I registered.
A man by the name of Murray MacNeil
was in the room, and there was a whole
line strung up before him. Next to
me there was a dumb Freshman.
Murray (this is just to you) asked him
what he thought he would like to take
up, Medicine or law. And the boy
said, “‘That’s just what I want you to
decide.’ By the time he finished with
the Freshman, he was pretty cross,
and he slammed down his hand on the
desk, and said, “‘NEXT,” and I was so
scared I could hardly speak. Halifax
is an awful place for shocks. :

Mom, next summer I am going to
study Biology at home. All you have
to do is cut up a frog, and I shall get
one out of our pond,

Lots of love,

Interscholastic Track Meet
Attracts Huge Crowd

Keen Competition Features Inter High School Athletic
Meeting.

It has been said of Dalhousie toat
thoroughness is one of her vptues and
that when she undertakes to do something, that thing is well done. The
recent Maritime Interscholastic Track

and Field Championships proved no

exception to this rule and both competitors and spectators felt tnat no
efforts had been spared to make the
gathering interesting and enjoyable.
The success of the meet far exceeded
the expectations of the Committee
and may be largely attributed to the
splendid response of the schools tarough
out the Maritimes. From the time,
when, at the request of the Halifax
High Schools, the University undertook to sponsor this Meet, the difficulties were fully realized, but, due to
the willing cooperation of teachcrs and
boys in these schools, they were greatly
minimized with the result that the
first Maritime Interscholastic Cham‘pionships was one of the biggest factors
yet in developing the proper spirit of
‘competition between the schools of
these provinces. Then the cooperation
of the M. P. B. A. A. U. of C., under
whose sanction the Championships
were held, must fot be overlooked.
Mr. C. D. Snipley, Secretary of that
body, gave willing assistance to the
Committee and it is felt that this
linking up of interscholastic sport with
the amateur authorities will be of
great benefit to all concerned and will
be a factor in their drive for Maritime
Olympic prospects. One direct result
is that, wnile in the past no records
have been filed, the marks made in
this Meet are to be recognized as

_ Maritime Interscholastic Records. And

what records they are!

When the pipers, in full regalia,
led the march past of competitors,
eighty-three young athletes, the pick

of the Marffimes, paraded in fine style

by schools, before the saluting base
where stood President A, Stanley
Mackenzie, G, Fred Pearson, and His
Worship Mayor Gastonguay. The
gods were propitious and provided
real Dalhousie weather which encouraged 2000 spectators to turn out and
cheer their favourites. As the Senate

had declared a half-holiday, hundreds

of Dalhousie students were on hand
to root for their old schools and seldom
has a more enthusiatic crowd. been
attracted by a sport programme in
Halifax. School yells split the air as
‘the winners of the various events were
announced while interest ran so high

- and competition so keen that, not until
the last event was over, did the crowd
leave the field in the semi-darkness

Keen competition was the order
of the day and this applied, not to a
few schools, but to all those entered.
Toe runners eliminated in the preiiminary sprints lost by close margins
and, as tne finals in the various races
approached, the crowd was set for
thrills—and they got them. In the
final of the 60 yard dash, Art Theakston of Colchester Academy nosed out
M. Lighter of Glace Bay by inches after
a terrific struggle. In the 100 yards
final, these same boys again furnished
the thrills by running a dead heat which
had to be re-run with the result that
Lighter got nis revenge by shoving his
chest across the tape first. Lignter
made the fastest time in both these
events—6 3-5 seconds in the 60 yards
and 10 3-5 seconds in the 100 yards,
both fast enough for senior ranks.
The 220 yards, won by C. R. Phillips
of K. C. S., and the 440 yards, won by
K. Kennedy, St. Mary’s Collegiate,
also provided great races and the times
of 25 seconds and 56 4-5 seconds are
fast enough to make many seniors
step. Jim Fahie, H. C. A, star, had
little difficulty in winning the 880
yards in 2 min. 11 4-5 seconds, with
a long track-covering stride, while
Sandy Purcell, junior star from Morrison School, Antigonish, showed rare
judgment in coming from behind in
the last quarter to take the mile run
in min. 7 8-5 seconds. Purcell
seemed fresh enough to have cut many
seconds off this mark if pushed. The
relays showed real competition between
well-balanced teams. In the 440 relay,

King's Collegiate won in 50 s.conds,
with H. C. A. gaining hand over fist
at the finish and Sydney taking third.
In the Mile Relay, Colchester Academy teamed well together to come
from behind in the third quarter to
Mary’s

win over Sydney, with St.

third. The time was 4 min. 10 1-5
seconds. The Committee, without hesitation, awarded special prizes for
both these events.

It is hard to pick individual stars
but the work of Sanford Henderson,
Kingston Consolidated School, N. B.,
certainly won him the cup for Indivvidual High Aggregate. This boy
took the High Jump at 5 feet and
heaved the 12 pound shot into the
win column with a put of 37 feet 10.8
inches, for a total of 10 points. Close
behind, came the two great rivals of
the day, M. Lighter, Glace Bay High,
and Art Theakston, Colchester Academy, who finished in a dead heat with
8 points each. As in the relays, the
University decided that these great
little runners-up should each be awarded special trophies. Mention must
be made of the Laidlaw brothers,
from New Glasgow High, who tied in
the Broad Jump at 19 feet 10.8 inches,
a mark which will stand some beating.

If individual honors were close,
team honors were even closer and the
result was in doubt until the last
jump of the Running High. Colchester Academy nosed out King’s
Collegiate by 1 point with a total of
19. The other schools were closely
bunched below that total and many
protestations were heard as to what
they would do next year. Perhaps
the outstanding and most gratifying
feature of the Meet was the splendid
sportsmanship shown by all the boys.
It is the quality which makes true sport
and when it is combined with keen
competition, we achieve our real aim.
The ones who did not win made the
winners show their best and kept
trying all the way. That is the true
spirit and its evidence means more
than the actual winning of a Meet.
Let's see more of it next year, boys!

 

Juniors Win

Dal Intermediates continued on their
road to success when they hammered
out a 8-0 victory over the intermediate
Wanderers in a game which was closely
contested from whistle to whistle.

Dal took the kick off in the first half
and pressed matters till their half line
co-operated in a play wnich sent over
the line the speedy Drover, who
collected the only touch-of the game.

The play during the second half
seasawed up and down the field and
many exciting moments were

erienced, but the Reds were succes
ully repulsed by the intermediate
Tigers.
Outstanding players for Dal in
cluded Drover, Oyler, Fraser, Cooper
and Bartlett, all of whom played
brilliant football. The game ended
3-0 for Dal.
