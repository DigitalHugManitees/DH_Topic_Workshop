CONVULSE AUDIENCE

(Glee Club performance produced
and directed by Arthur Murphy.)

The first meeting of the Glee Club
‘since Christmas took place last Thursday
at the Gymnasium, when Mr. Arthur

“Murphy added to an already lengthy

list of successful performances in the

presentation of a programme entitled
‘

“Hash”. :

Even the jaundiced eye of a professional critic could have found few
faults with “Hash”, for a college show.
The general impression from first to
last was good. Each individual number was splendid. The programme
was a well balanced one and the very
order of presentation showed considerable skill of arrangement. In view of

the fact that this was an amateur show,

at the right time. Pianos were
taken on and off the stage in short
order and sets were up from the begin
ning of the show, or placed where they

could be quickly assembled, so that

_ there was less hitch than usual, although

the stage hands were given a certain

‘amount of breathing space at times,
while the Symphony Orchestra played
from the floor of the gym.

VIVE LE ROI

The programme opened with a one
act play “Viva ‘e Roi’, the original
‘composition of Mr. Arthur Murphy.
The scene is the basement home of one
John Smith, below the city’s thorougha and acioining the press room of a
great city newspaper from which comes
the intermittent sound of the presses
being run. From the moment the
curtain rises it becomes apparent that
Smith is a very sick man, and he is
pleading with his wife to stop the
roaring of the presses which he feels
will drive him insane. His wife tells
him that the presses are running continuously because of the demand for
news of the kings illness. The noise
ceases and the sick man declares that
if it starts again it will kill him. He
curses the king etc., etc. Their boy
comes in with the information that the
presses are through for the night but
that if the king dies a special edition
will be struck off. Another issue 1s
struck off. The wife turns to her
husbarid's bedside to find that he too
has passed on.

The play was short and strong, rather
a scene than an act, lacking something
of that “certain magnitude’. It was

suggestive of some of the more morbid.

varieties of the Irish School of play
wrights. The plot was fresh, holding
the interest and arousing one’s sympathy
but the philosophy of John Smith,
contrasting sant and king, was as
old as the hills and rather transparent.

very forceful, and_ Irene Allen, the
wife gave a satisfying performance of

her part. “Their boy’ Georgie Mur

HALLERS HEAD
LISTS FOR NEW
YEAR BOOK

ARTISTIC AND DISTINCTLY
COLLEGIATE

Ambitious Staff

Although the subscription campaign
for the 1929 edition of the year-book,
got under way only last Monday,
students of the university are rapidly
signing up for the annual.

Business Manager Ronald McColl
attributes the haste, shown by students
to subscribe, to the fact that the New
Year Book will be by far the finest
ever published.

Printed by one of the largest and best
publisher of annuals, and_ radically
altered both in outward appearance
and in content, the 1929 annual will be
an outstanding example of fine bookmaking, in both the mechanical and
editorial senses.

The Year Book plays a much greater
Part, than is generally appreciated. in
developing college spirit. It is the
only means whereby all the university
and all of its functions and activities
can be represented at once and _ together. The annual emphasizes as
nothing else can do, the whole—the
college itself.. It is the expression of the
soul of Dalhousie.

The many new features in the book
will make the Year Book even more
valuable than it has been in the past.
The editors of the annual are confident
that the new features added this year
will meet with the heartiest approval
of the students

Over 75% of the girls at Shirreff Hall
have so far signed up for their copy.
Canvassers for subscriptions are now
out in full force. At any other University the charge is $10—at Dalhousie
you get this splendid record of the year
for $2.50. Sign up NOW!

NOTABLE BANQUET

In the rest of this Old University of
ours, everybody has known for weeks the
results of the ‘war’, (and Dame Rumour
has it that the casualties among the
“common people’ were many—both
dead and wounded), but it was not
until Wednesday the 16th of this month
that the fates of the most important
members of the said university were
known (to any but the persons cleciding
the fates). Yes, it was the 16th of
January when the results of the Law
exains were posted up.

What did the Lawyers do?

They celebrated! As only they know
how to celebrate—everybody entered
into the spirit of the thing.

The “Where?” and ‘‘When?” are
respectively, the St. Julien Room of the
Halifax Hotel (inter alia locu), and
seven o'clock until —A. M. beginning
Wednesday the 16th and ending the
17th (for some).

And How?—Oh-h-h !?!!??!

The Banquet started when the President of the Law Society said the magic
words “The King’. Then one of those
real dinners was served— the kind only
the ‘“‘Halifax’’ knows how to serve—
the future judges, Jaw lords and Premiers ate, and were merry.

Many speeches were made (some were
enjoyed). Among the speakers was
the present editor of the Gazette (he is
incidentally studying law)—he was
interrupted by consistent and hearty
(very) applause. (He finally sat down).

The Lord Chief Justice of England
who came especially to speak to the
Society delivered a very inspiring and
telling speech—all of the boys are
thoroughly convinced that they are
future Premiers—‘‘Someday the multitudes will be clapping one of you as

CREDIT DUE DEAN J. E. READ]
AND PROF. H. E. READ

 

Several issues ago there appeared in
the Gazette a tribute to the Dalhousie
Contingent C. OQ. T. C.. During the
war the Dalhousie C. O. T. C. was
formed and many of its members took
commissions with units serving in
France. The corps has not been active
during the past few years but through
the efforts of the Board of Governors
the initial procedures were carried out
to reorganize it. Great credit is due
to Dean Read and Prof. Horace Read
for their untiring efforts in this reorganization.

MAJOR. J. S. ROPER COMMANDING OFFICER

At a meeting of the Military Committee consisting of Col. W. E. Thompson, Major J. S. Roper, Dean J. E. Read,
Prof. H. E. Read, Prof. Theakston,
Lt. Col. H. C. Sparling, and four membeers of the student body, Major J. S.
Roper was elected commanding officer.
We are fortunate to have a man possessing such ability and military record, to
take over this important position. Our
officer commanding is putting into use
his years of military experience.

COMMISSIONS

At a later meeting of the military
committee held at the residence of the
commanding officer the four remaining
officers were appointed from the stud
their leader'’—Mrn Keyes arises and
bows modestly.

Lord Shaw of Dumfermline proposed
a toast to exams—a very witty speech—
the only one comparable to it being that
of the ‘“‘respondent’’-—our Sir Walter
Hagen (or is it Beau Brummell?)

Joe Mills provided music—Dal songs,
and ‘“‘Parlez vous'’—these were joined
in with hearty voices by the boys who
were not too busy eating. Kelly Morton
also showed that there was great talent
among the lawyers by a masterful rendition of “Hermie the Firefighter.’’
And you should have heard the President (not Stan!) singing in Gaelic!
| forgot the name and the words, but it
was good.

Jack McQuarrie and ‘‘Dunc”’ also gave
the boys a few words to conjure with
and loud were the cheers. (Clyde Keyes |
was official cheer leader for the occasion
and did remarkably well—he needed no
assistance).

There were many other sources of
entertainment which will not be mentioned here (too numerous to mention).

The banquet closed with the Law Yell
and “The King’’,—all agreed that it was
a howling success.

What happened afterwards? well—

That's nobody's. business!

ent body. Those eligible for commissions were obtained from information

 

furnished through military headquarters. |

These officers were chosen chiefly from
the standing of their previously obtained military qualifications. Dalhousie is
fortunate in having enrolled amongst
its members about twenty officers
holding commissions in the Non-permanent active militia as well as a great
many, having signed as other ranks in
units throughout the Maritimes.

Norman Bayne officer in the Engineers is second in command. Norm
has had a great deal of military experience and he is the proper man to occupy
this important post.

George Mahon Lieut. in the Halifax
Rifles has been transferred from this
unit to the C. O. T. C. in order to fill the
position of adjutant.

Lieutenant Wishart, graduate of the
U. N. B. Contingent C. O. T. C. commands No. 1 platoon.

Lieutenant Faulkner for the past
three years’ Lieut. in the Kings Canadian Hussars is commanding No. 2
Platoon.

ENROL BEFORE WEDNESDAY

~~

The corps has been organized as a
company having for the present two
platoons. Roll sheets will be closed
Wednesday evening for this year and
anyone who wishes to join will have to
act quickly.

AIMS AND HOPES

Next year we hope to be able to carry
out a more diversified training program by adding different classes of
training. It won't be long before a
Medical Corps Cavalry troop will be
added. Rifle shooting always a big
attraction in military circles will be
taken up in real earnest and backed by
sufficient funds the standing of Dalhousie should be high in the intercollegiate shoot. Rivalry should be
high in meets between the Technical
College and Dalhousie. We have many
of the leading rifle shots of the Maritimes attending our University and the
aim of the C. O. T. C. is to bring these

shots out so that they may bring fame} from former Dalhousians.

to Dalhousie.
IN GENERAL

It has taken time but the enthusiasm
has now been aroused and the students
have shown the real spirit. We have
very close to one-hundred men enrolled
and attending parades. Members of
the contingent are paid a sum averaging
about fifteen dollars per man. It has
been suggested that members pool at
least part of their pay so that a fund
will Ee provided to provide social
attractions.

JUNIORS-SENIORS IN FIRST
FORENSIC FEUD

Entries for Teams

Sodales is planing to begin the interclass debating competition for the
Bennet Trophy almost immediately
after the main trials for the three university teams. It is absolutely necessary
that the classes pick their teams without
further delay as the first debate in the
competition will be held very soon.

Each team is to consist of two, a
boy and a girl. The debates will be
run very much like any ordinary
meeting of the debating society: The
two teams will argue the question at
issue, and will be judged, 1n all probability, by members of the faculty
who are interested in debating. While
the judges are deliverating which group
of orators performed with the higher
degree of ability, the meeting willbe
thrown open and everyone may have
an opportunity of giving the audience
the benefit of his or her opinion. The
subjects will all be of a genial nature,
and should be of interest to all the
students. Sodales expects the student
body to turn out and support the various
teams with such enthusiasm, that the
generosity of the Honourable R. B,
Bennett will not be without results.

The first debate will be the JuniorSenior and it is the intention of the
Society to hold it the week following
the University Trial Debates. The
subject chosen for the Junior-Senior
contest is ‘Resolved that the idea of
Human progress is a delusion.’’ Everybody should be present to hear the
learned Seniors and Juniors expostulate
on a subject of such depth and importance,

Dalhousie Glee Club under the direction of Sina S. Singer was again heard
over the air Sunday evening between
the hours of 8 pm. and 9 p.m.. This
was the second of this series of concerts
which in all probability will continue
until the musical comedy ‘‘Carrie Comes
to College” is put on. The programme
opened like the last one with a group
of marches.

(1) Shirreff Hall March.

(2) Victorious Legion March.

(3) Trisgian.

(4) The North Wind.

The ever popular “Blue Danube

Waltz” of Strauss followed these and
a medley of old English airs arranged
for waltz time called “Old England
Waltzes.” :

John Budd played a piano solo
“Manhatten Serenade,” and the programme ended with a group of selections

trom “Carrie Comes to College’’ with
Minnie Black the leading lady as
soloist.

Numerous letters were received from
away during the week congratulating
Dalhousie, but strange to say none
Major Borrett took the opportunity during one of
the pauses to wish in the name of Dalhousie her best wishes to members of
other universities who might be listening in.

Next Sunday evening Mr. Singer
plans to play quite a few Scotch select
tons, so all the Cape Bretoners should

avail themselves of the chance and
make sure they are near a radio around
8 P.M. An overture or so will relieve the

BEHAVIOR TO BE STUDIED

By G. A. B.

 

It has been officially announced that
a School of Psychology for Social
Workers will be opened at the Dalhousie
Public Health Clinic on January 28.

This school is really the progeny of a
series of fruitful and instructive lectures
which Dr. Prince has been delivering
before the clinic, at irregular intervals,
for the past few years. It is felt that
the opportunities it offers to institutional
workers alone, will amply justify the
efforts expended by Dr. Prince and his
co-workers. The course is of invaluable
assistance to those who, in their duties
as instructors cope with a great diversity
of social problems, such as child guidance, personality and social behavior.

A section of the course, will deal with
parent-education. The importance of
this factor requires no particular stressing, since it is a necessary and very
fundamental feature in any course
which pretends to solve even the most
superficial problems of our society.
Psychialtry is really only in its infancy
and this school will be the first -of its
kind in Eastern Canada.

Dr. Prince is especially fortunate in
having as associates such eminent social
workers as Dr. Clyde Marshall, Dr.
Frances. Marshall, and -Professor N.
J. Lymons. Years of preceptional experience has given tham a_ thorough,
varied, and practical knowledge of
psychiatry. Professor Lymons has read
many papers on psychological subjects
before various local clubs and the
two Drs. Marshall are almost equally
well-known to Halifax audiences. Mrs.
Marshall will conduct the special
classes in the guidance of child development. There will be sessions. every
Monday and Wednesday evening to
consider problems connected with the
social life of children and adults ard
sections of the. class will also‘meet: at
certain intervals, .oo Friday’ evenings
for practical demonstrations of modern
methods of dealing with problem children adult social behavior cases.

This projected school ‘in Psychialtry
is really a further development of the
Sociology Club at Dalhousie. which
was founded by Dr. Prince about three
vears ago.
creasing in popularity and is already
gaining favorable recognition among
other student groups is a mark of its
importance and a just desert of its
humanitarian aims and interests. After
all, too much cannot be said in favor of
such movements, because they. are
hased, ultimately, on the most vital
and fundamental principles of life, and
the degree of progress attained by future
generations will be largeiy determined
by the success attending the solution of
social problems. Dr. Prince has us
selfishly sacrificed a great deal of time
and energy both in fostering the
Sociology Club and in unstintedly
offering his services in any social welfare
work promoted by lIeccal interests.
Dr. Prince has grasped all the proverbial “‘golden opportunities."’ Every stranger of Sociological repute who appears
in Halifax is sure to be spotted by the
entertaining Doctor and engaged to
lecture before the Sociology Club or the

ienced by a robust youthful spirit.

There is not one item of student life that is not brought within the
purview of N. F.C. U.S. To make sure that nothing is left out—
“A Commission on Student Problems’ has been established: a
sort of clearing house for all student problems.

- But even broader than the boundaries of nationalism—is the
scope of N. F. C. U. S.: inter-imperial and inter-national relations
are admirably maintained through the National Union of Students
of England and Wales (N. U. S.), and The National Students
Federation of America, U.S. A., (N.S. F. A.)

The program of N. F. C. U.S. is bold. It is symbolical of the
vision ambition, imagination and the love of great things, experIt is a noble, majestic gesture,
indeed. A seeking after Unity in Variety; Variety in Unity.

It is not merely a joining of hands that extends across a broad
continent from the wave-beaten shores of the Atlantic to the
Pacific; it is even more than bridging’ those ravines of national
Sectionalism that seems to be turning more than one heard, gray
if at all, and (N. F. C. U.S. is only four years in the public service).
No upper, nor lower, nor central nor western—but just one Canada
from coast to coast; it is something more: a youthful sincere effort,

to bring about a mutuality through comradeship, based, not on

tolerance, but on equality and a desire for co-operative advancement.

N. F. C. U.S. and its kindred organs, the N. V. S. and N. S.
F. A. are surely building on firm foundations. They are, one might
almost say, fulfilling a prophesy ventured by that versatile Welshman Lloyd George—to the effect that after the great war a new
and better civilization would arise, lofty in its outlook.

It is certain that a new character is forming: one that makes
for frankness and open, above-board dealing—that scatters to all
the winds that blow mediaeval secrecy and intrigue. _

It may well be said that this is the cradle in which that much
sought after international mind will be nurtured; this is the: cradle
whence will come that delicate noble child, culture; this -is the
cradle whence will come that spirit of co-operation, that brotherhood
which is sought alike by cleric, socialist and scientist.

University Library

Students were regaled, when returning from their vacations
when they read the announcements the bulletin boards that Libr
be permanent and as such is new. The announcément comprised only
a few words but what stories may some day tell: Library open every
evening; more literature, more science, more art: more life. The
value cannot be calculated from the cost of electric light bills.
It is on a slightly different reckoning that the profits from these
must be evaluated.

The special feature is the attraction offered the young men of
the Universitv: fair intellectual co-eds are every evening doing the
honours and any young cavalier may now receive his ‘‘source of
knowledge” across the counter with a certain spiritual uplift, which
can come only through gazing in magic of the eyes of a co-ed.

_ Might we suggest that a young man be added to the evening
Staff? (We are not trying to suggest that this would attract the
opposites.) '

We might add that it is certainly no loss to the University to
keep open Library—with young ladies and gentlemen as keepers;
for then it may truly be said with Scott:

“Yet if one heart throh higher at its sway

The wizard note had not been touched in vain.”

(No. 3 continued)

My dear G............. though you know

me very well in many ways, you always]

had every cause to believe me an incurable woman hater. So you can
hardly imagine how I felt the night
when—bright stars our only witnesses—
I met Vereneli, or Fanni as I more often
called, her alone on that little island—
met Fanni, the girl of my boyhood
dreams, my then constant companion
and my first love. We had neither
seen nor spoken, nor written to each
other for ten years. Many things had
happened to each of us in that time, so
that those ten years lay like a dark and
impassible abyss between her and: me.
And so we unexpectedly stood before
each other: she, I believe, with some
trepidation, and evident alarm; l,
with suppressed eagerness and wonder.

“Fanni’, I whispered tremulously
after a prolongued silence—during which
time Fanni, judging by her actions
yesterday and the day before, had
probably been meditating flight—‘Fanni, let us be friends once more.”

“Yeorg,"’ she answered—she had
always called me Yoerg, I cannot
remember why—'‘Yoerg, it is late, |
must go home.”

“Had you not found me here,” |
replied, “you would have stayed a
while, would you not, Fanni?”’

Fanni did not answer. Bu tpresently
we walked over to a large boulder and
sat down, facing the upper end of the
lake and the dark masses of mountains
toward sunrise.

“It is a beautiful night, Fanni,’’ I
observed, after we had sat a while
looking out upon the starry waters in
silence.

A further pause ensued, then said she,

“The moon will rise, presently.”’

And I, boldly, ‘“Then I shall see you
again in the moonlight.”

Fanni made no reply. As I looked
out upon the water again I saw the
stars tremble on faintly perceptible
ripples.

“Many things have happened since
last we met, Fanni. Nit wahr?”’
“Yes, Yoerd, it is as you say.

things have happened.”

Then after some hesitation,

‘“Maybe you are married now?”

But she, quickly, “No, Yoerg.”’

“Engaged perhaps?”

After a long silence,
audible voice,

Many

“Perhaps,”
At that, with my heart full of doubt
and sorrow, | looked to the mountains
in the East. looked a long time.
Fanni suggested rowing home» But
she did not move, and presently I
remarked, with abated breath,

“The moon, Fanni, will not rise tonight.”

“Why not, Yoerg?”’

“There are heavy clouds coming up
from behind the Glarnish, Fanni, and
an ominous wind is beginning to blow.”

“Then let us hasten home, Yoerg.”’

“Yes Fanni, it were well, I think.”

But neither of us rose, and I moved
closer to Fanni and placed my hand on
her hand, where it lay in the grass.
We looked at each other, and I read
what was in her mind.

“You remember?”

We both remembered well. It was a
night in late Summer—the last one I had
spent at our old home in Staefa—Fanni
and I, youthful lovers, and even more
taciturn than now, were on this selfsame island when a sudden storm came
sweeping down the lake. And. we
swept with it in our sail-boat down to
Erlenbach—miles below Staefa. These
memories had at once brought us closer
to each other. Had built a firm bridge
over the abyss of ten years’ parting.
the mere suggestion of that memorable
day, the mere prospect of another like
it, had made us friends again. Fanni
and I as of old.

But we did not give expression to these
thoughts. After we had sat another
little while, aware now only of each
other’s presence, Fanni asked, wistfully,
“Have you a sail?’’ and by the light of
the stars above I saw a strange and yet
familiar glow in her eyes.

I have that, Fanni,’’ I replied, ‘‘and
you may trust me still.”

“Then shall we sail, Yoerg?’’

We would sail presently. The wind
was not yet high enough. So we sat
side by side, my shoulder touching hers,
listening to the wind blowing through
the little cluster of trees on our islet.
Dark waves began to splash against
the rocks just below our feet, and
presently there were no more stars
above, only a few on the Western horizon. The storm bells began to ring on
the isle of Ufenau and at Raperswil.

SOLITUDE

 

The setting sun now sinks to rest,
The moon is come to take its place.
The placid lake far, far below,

Does take upon itself the hue

Of silvery light; serene and clear.

‘A cool delightful breeze is felt,
Gently blowing from the land.
Enwrapped by silence calm.and still. |
Above—the occasional flip of wing,
A dive, a splash, and then a cry

Of discontent—all in vain.
Then—silence once more reigns.

And lo!—-from east there comes to view
A shadow scarcely moving-—seen
Glist’ning like some rarest gem—

A paddle’s dip ‘scarce audible,

And soon the rays of silvery moon,
Shines down on Indian handicraft;

It slowly glides and soon is lost—

A speck towards far-off west.

Once more am I in silence, left,

With God alone, my guardian ee

TWILIGHT AND AFTER

 

Wanders the sun
Down by the hiil
Shadows come,
Winds are still,

The shivering leaves
Their crying cease,
And peace is theirs
Who knew no peace.

Wanders the moon
Down by the sea,
Memories came
Hauntingly
Out of the night,
Ghosts of the dead
They mock our peace
And peace has fled.

GREY GOOSE CALL

 

Dull silver is the gray goose call

Across the trailing Northward ways,

High and clear in the Northern lights

Its music sways,

A thing of ice and sheen. of snow,

A glory of freedom to fill the nights

When the white winds blow;

Through the sudden fire of the midnight sun

It’s wistful beauty outward flings

A passing flare of outspread wings,

To catch and hold the stunted trees

And hush to peace their shisperings.

I have no words, whose only craft is
words,

I have no prayers, who have prayed by
night and day;

Tragedy, with the jesters’ cap and bells,

Has come into my house and means to
stay.

I would have barred my windows and
my doors,

Had I but known the fiend and all his
guile;

But laughter was tangled up in the
things he said,

And he looked so harmless with his
clownish smile.

My heart was lonely, and so I let him in.
Ah, foolish was I who did not under
stand

That the fool of life has broken hearts
for toys,

And a tear and a jest go always hand in
hand!

Perhaps it was what she ate for supper,

Betty was talking to George on the

she'd better go. George misunderstood
and came up to rescue her. Miss Lowe
would not let him in the door, so he
went home and read the last instalment
of ‘Burning Beauty’’ by Temple_Bailey

On Thursday of last- week-the ‘girls
on the third floor planned a sleighing
party, the weather was so cold. On
Friday it became warmer and the party
was abandoned. In fact, it was so
warm that a certain girl at the Newman
Club Dance felt the need of finding a
barber shop to get an immediate haircut.

The latest exercise on the B.floor is

We wonder if a certain freshette

for the man she is inviting to the class
party!

Mysterious knocks have been heard
lately on the third floor. Some freshettes are convinced that the place is
haunted.

It isn’t good luck to tell anyone on the

NEWMAN CLUB
-——~—'-‘ The Newman Club of Dalhousie

and educating little address.

ON RIDICULE

It is too bad that people cannot be
taught to face themselves as others see
them. Half of the criticism which ts
showered on us from the cradle to the
‘grave is well-meant. Some humans,
the moment a weakness is revealed,
run away from the place of revealment.
This is no attitude to adopt. Take
all criticism with a smile and study
yourself in its light. 1 am not exactly
an antique, but I have passed the
“foolish years’. In all my days I have
learnt much that would never have
been my privilege to know if my weaknesses hadn't been mocked. I hope it
has improved my general make-up. At
least it has strengthened my sense of
humor. New college students are as a
rule, held up to ridicule. But dont
run away from it, stay and laugh with
the others. —A: Senior.

Some will show you the way to ultimats
truth and immortality, yet again othere
will fill your mind with faith in false
gods and cause you to fear death.
Before you touch this medicine, find
one who knows its true value and effect.”’

But no such man could be found in
the land, so the ignorant one, having
gone thus far, thought he would at
east taste a little of this and that
medicine, to see if he might not be cured.
After four long years, however, he left
the chest of learning in despair, his
mind a greater turmoil than ever.

O, how I wish that I might live in this
room always. Here the hours go slowly,
they are so burdened with beauty.
Here the shadows lie softly, for they lie
on beloved things. I should know less
sorrow here and have more leisure for
dreaming. Regrets would less often
haunt me here then the breath of roses in
the dark, the ghosts of satiny roses that
are cool on my cheek to-night. And
who will say that you might not someday come, and sit by the window and
read, in your blue gown, while I kept
very still, lest you vanish away? Then
would the room -be complete as it is
now, like a flawless song that knows no

would be or not, | should always have
the roses, the ghosts of the roses, to
stir my dreams while | slept.

MEDICAL SOCIETY

Next Thursday evening is set aside
for the regular meeting of the Student
Medical Society. Important business
will be carried on and reports from the
various committees will be heard. An
interesting programme of communications and cases will be carried out
and the evening should prove very

get along satisfactorily without funds,

but with capital behind it the C. O. T.
C. can be made most interesting. The
time might come when a C. O. T. C
fraternity will be formed. It is not too
soon to start thinking about these things.

CAMP

The camp in all probability will be
held at MacNabs Island directly after
the spring examinations for a period of
about one week. Anyone who _ has
been to military camps knows what a
wonderful time the boys have, learning
the most interesting parts of military
training.

TRAINING AS OPTIONAL SUBJECT?

It is hoped that the true value of the
training offered will be fully recognized
and that C. O. T. C. training will count
as an optional subject. Another hope
is that such training will be compulsory
for the first and second year studénts.

PRESIDENT GIVES SUPPORT

President MacKenzie is giving the
corps his full hearted support in providing space required in the University
buildings. With the proper authorities
behind this organization it should become one of the outstanding branches
of student activities.

PARADES

Every Wednesday evening parades are
held in the gymnasium from seven to
nine. Capt. Beresford and Sergt. Major
Hill want a real group of men to work
with. These permanent force men are
highly qualified to give such instruction
and the C.O. T. C. is favored to have
them withus.

Those interested in this branch of
military work predict that Dalhousie
University will furnish many capable
officers for military units. This training furnishes adequate qualifications for
a commission in the Canadian Militia.

At the time of writing the non-commissioned officers have not been app
ointed. Don’t be alarmed if you see

a group of men in khaki running around

WHAT HAVE WE HERE?

-}The curtains parted again to disclose
our old friend Graham Allen disguised as
“Thompson” with a fine coating of
burnt cork, immaculately dressed in
evening suit and shite gloves. His
an imitation of the many
thousands of “St. Louis Blues’ and
“Goin’ Back to Mammy” singers was
original and entertaining. His B. number “Oh death where is thy Sting’
accompanied by John Budd, literally
convulsed the audience.

Later in the even Graham again
appeared, this time doubling with Miss
Margaret Mackie in ‘‘Moron and Mackie.”’ Their: act sparkled with witty
repartee and rapid fire observations
about persons and things in and around
the campus. (Graham and his partner
put the audience into such a great mood
that numbers following were assured
of a sympathetic hearing.

“FOR ALWAYS”

A waltz song “For Always”, the
original composition of Frank Hebb,
with words by Arthur Murphy was
sweetly sung by Miss Lorna Stuckey.
Dalhousians have every right to feel
proud of Mr. Hebb’s¢ achievement.
This is -the first original composition
to have been played at Glee Club,
within the writer’s memory, and it was
a very creditable performance. To
those who are lovers of the arts this
was a most encouraging beginning, and
it is to be hoped that this will not be
the last composition which the Glee
Club will hear from Mr. Hebb.

In the following number ‘‘The Toilers’’
song, Bunker Murphy dressed as a
darkey sang “‘Man_ River’. On the
opposite ‘side of the stage Donald
Forsythe typifying the toiling student,
sang a parody on “Old Man River”,
“Old Dalhousie’.

The scene of the last number, a

leaves in its wake a fearful toll of human
life. The play is a take off of the grand
style of the 16th century. The time is
1928 and the costumes modern but the
language is that of Shakespeare et’ al,
and abounds -in , long mouth-filling
lines and wordy declamation.

As the play reaches its “‘climax’’ and
Plum public detective, killed Sneak
private detective, the audience began to
get the point. Each of the succeeding
seven deaths was greeted with an expectant roar of glee. The death of
Len Miller, the last member of the
cast to pass out was a masterpiece of
dramatic suicide. It took no less than
eight stabbings to put him out, while
in the intervals, keeping his knife
poised for the next thrust, he gave
whole pages of blank verse. His last
words were, “And thus I die without a
word.” The play was well directed.
During its whole course no member of
the cast stepped out of character. ;

Alex McKinnon, as Lord Withers,
is a new discovery and his acting was
very fine. He combined an easy stage
presence with beautifully clear diction,
and seemed quite suited to the part
of poetic love maker. Jean Morton
as Lady Lactitia looked very pretty
and acted well, as did also her mother,

‘ball title and the Sterling cup by defeat
ing Commerce in straight games in a
three game series. The Meds won the
first game on Friday night hy a score

of 22—6 and the second game on Satur
day afternoon by 8—6.

The game on Friday night was as
one-sided as the score indicates, Meds
taking the Jead in the first inning and
keeping it throughout. They put the

me away in the ice box in the third
inning with a batting spree that netted
nine runs. In the fourth they added six
more, while in the fifth they crossed the
platter once. Bernie Eaton, who was
serving them up for the Forrest Building
outfit, made a sweet job of it and had the
Commerce team at his mercy. The
financiers scored twice in the first session
twice in the second and one each in the
third and fourth innings, while in the
fifth they could not register. In the
field the Meds worked well, but with the
exception of the second and last innings
the Commerce ten looked little like the
squad that won section B of the league
without a defeat, errors being as prominent as outs.

The Saturday afternoon fracas was
one of the most interesting and best

layed games of the league. The big
eatures of the game were a sensational
catch by Minshull in the fourth and a
seven run rally by Meds in the third
inning, while Commerce returned to
form in the field and turned in a much

City League.

that Dal have at present a team of
senior calibre. The Halifax City League
at best is only on a par with the old
intermediate league. It’s not in the
same class with the Eastern League
although it has the same privilege of
entering the winner in the provincial
play-offs. If the winner should draw
to play with the Kentville Wildcats,
the Truro Bearcats, the Halifax Socials,
or the Wolverines, then you can expect
a slaughter of no mean proportions.
Considering the City League in its
right plane, there is little to be found
fault with the brand of play provided
by the different teams. There are
many young fast players, players who
will eventually advance to real senior
hockey and be a credit to it. The one
thing that is now impeding their progress
is the lack of interest displayed in their
games by the fans at large and the
supporters of the different teams in
particular. Dalhousie is probably the
greatest sinner in this respect. Obviously the students must expect star teams
to mature over-night and crack players
to develop after a week of high class
coaching. Much has been made over
the fact that the Glee Club staged a
show on the same night the Tigers were
playing. But Glee Club or no Glee

takes place they'll shout their heads

when they are asked to lay out the
frightful sum of thirty-five cents to
support the present team they laugh
and try to show how much they know
about hockey. Then they spend the
thirty-five cents in order to see Greta
Garbo and John Gilbert stage a wrestling match or Clara Bow run around
in her ‘undies. Aw well Cui Bono,

Meds countered once, as did Commerce
in the first of the third. In the last
of the third the Meds struck a hitting
streak and a lucky streak. Some hard
hits, coupled with several that stayed
up on the wire and were good for one
base, sent seven of the winners scurrying
over the plate. Commerce brought
their total up to six in the fourth and
once more sent the Meds back with the

men up in the last inning got to base, but
Eaton struck one out and the Meds
ended the game with a snappy double
play, the fifth of the afternoon. Commerce made two of the twin killings and
Meds three.

Mr. Sterling umpired at the plate
on both occasions. H. Harris looked
after the bases in the first game and
Alec Nickerson in the secound encounter.

GARRICK NOTES

“Little Spitfire’ is the intriguing
title of the play in which the Carroll
Players will be seen at the Garrick during
the coming week, and undoubtedly this
will prove to be one of the liveliest offerings of the entire season. Those who
familiar with this Broadway success,
claim for it that it is one of the ‘‘pepplest’’ plays to be found on the stage
today, and that there is not a dull
moment from curtain to curtain. It is
declared to be particularly delightful
to audiences of about the college student
age, who prefer a play with ‘‘snap” and

“eee
iss Mabel Grainger has a wonderful
role in this play, and it is interesting
to note that her return is particularly
warmly welcomed by the college set.
It is a light comedy with a ‘wow’ of
a fight between two female ‘‘wildcats”’.

and Mackinnon, handed
out stiff checks and helped materially
to keep the Crescents at bay. Bernie
Eaton scintilatted in the forward line
and was ably supported by Oyler and
Thompson. Max Brennan performed
usefully as a sub. The Crescents
‘had a strong team and man for man
‘looked better than the Tigers; but the
Tigers won and deserved to win.

Monday night the Tigers took
trimming from the fast skating Wanderers sextette. The Red’s outfit showed
a world of speed, more experience, and
deserved their 3--1 win. The Dal
defense again worked desperately to
stave off the clever attacks of Foley,
McGlashen, and Smith. The Dal forwards were outclassed but seemed
a bit off form. Their one chance
against teams made up of such fast
men is to play ‘“‘com”, ‘‘com”’ again,
and ‘“‘com”’ always. They are coached
to do it. When they forget, they are
done. Let’s hope they'll not forget
anymore. Next Thursday they meet
Dartmouth. Here’s the team—and it’s
worth seeing.

Goal: Ferguson, sub goal: fan Fraser;
defense: Wickwire, MacKinnon; forwards: Eaton, Oyler, Thompson; subs:
Brennan, Power, Taylor.

In the first game mentioned above
the refereeing was rotten, in the second
game it was almost as bad. Monaghan
handled the first, Wonnacott the second.

TIGER HOOPSTERS
TAKE VICTORY

In a fast overtime game played in the
Y gym Saturday night the Dalhousie
basketha!ll quintette snatched a 37-33
victory from the Nova Scotia Tech.
The game, which was the opener of the
Halifax City league, was featured by the
combination of the Dal forwards, the
shooting of Davidson and the large
turn-out of Tiger supporters. :

Harold Davidson, whose sensational
work featured the Xmas tour of the
Dal hoopsters, again accounted for the
majority of his team's counters—scoring
a total of twenty-five points. ‘“Davy"’
displayed fast floor work and hooped
the rim with shots from all distances and
angles.

While Davidson was the brilliant
star of the Dal outfit the whole five

 

 

players played steady basketball. Mac- |

Odrum and Parker at guard were
practically impregnable and very seldom
did a Tech player hreak through for
a close in shot. Don McRae at center
layed a nice defensive game and in the
first period had his rival center tied up
in knots. In the second frame McRae
got his eye on the Tech basket and
rolled in a total of eight points. Captain
George McLeod was below par in shooting but displayed some brilliant floor
work and started many combination
attacks that ended in scores.

TOMORROW NIGHT

Tomorrow night the Tiger basketballers will hook up with the Y. M.C. A.
in what promises to be the feature
hoop meet of the year. Both the Y
and Dal came through with victories
in their first league games this season
but that doesn't say who will win out.

The intermediate game startsat 6.30
and the senior tussle at 8.30.

It has just been brought to'light that
the Dal intermediate hoop squad should
have won against the Garrison in the
first game of the season. It is claimed
that the scorer omitted to chalk up the
last two points of the game, two points
which would have given Dalhousie
victory. It is expected that the Basketball association will look into the matter.
