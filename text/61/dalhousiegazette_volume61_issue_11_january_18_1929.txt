RIAL DEBATE
WED. JAN. 30
Me — 3 SUBJ ECTS

CENSORSHIP, ST. LAW“RENCE AND WAR TO
BE DEBATED.

e 3 The Trial Debates, will be held
ay Wednesday evening, Jan. 30. Everyone
% in the university having any inclination
ei ‘to debating must take part. Dalhousie
; has plenty of material and it needs the
wna support of all its students in order to
es get three of the best teams it has ever
put on the debating platform. All the
teams which our representatives are to
‘meet are good, and the subjects should
‘ede B38, and ively di ussion.
- The debate with the representatives
of the Western Universities is to be
held very early in March. The subject
chosen is ‘‘Resolyed that this house is
opposed to all forms of censorship.” _

The date set for the Newfoundland
debate is March 22 and the subject
chosen is “Resolved that war hinders
human progress.”

The Intercollegiate Debate is with
Kings University. The subject is
“Resolved that the St. Lawrence Waterway Project is for the benefit of Canada. "

Those trying for any team may
speak on whichever subject they so
desire and may uphold either negative
or affirmative. The fact that you
speak on the subject to be discussed
at one debate does not make you ineligible for a place on a team which is
fe a to take part in one of the other debates.
Sodales encourages everybody to

come out and speak in these trials.

It is an opportunity to get practice in

public speaking, which should never

be neglected. Freshmen are especially

requested to come and show their

ability. Privilege though it be indeed,

it is more than a privilege. It isa duty.

It is a duty incumbant on every stud
ent who has any vocal powers what
soever, however slight he may think

Paes p those powers. If you are doubtful

about your knowledge of the subject

any member of the inter-collegiate

committee will be only too glad to help
you out.

Do not hesitate but hand your names
to the officers of Sodales without delay,
and make these trials the largest in the
hey, history of the Society.

Trials will be held Wednesday,

On Friday night Jan. 11, an elimination tournament was held at the gym.
Forrest Musgrave was the winner.
During the evening many pleasing
discovertes “were ©
new stars. Hart and Tilley, two new
men showing up exceptionally well.

passed beyond them are the makers of
mighty dreams. For some the dream
is dim, for some it is star-like and clear;
but the old halls have a spell to make
the least dreamer wise, and there is a
secret in the land which is whispered
by the people to one another, whith the
trees themselves know, and the very
stones which the builders used in the
years before. And this secret is of a
thing which shall forever remain, which
shall forever be true, and dauntless, and
beautiful. It isa secret which the young
men carry away in their strength, and
the young women wear in the light
upon their faces when they come to the
gates for the last time of all. Gates of
the World! Behind is the land they
have loved with the secret in its heart.
Before them is the other country, new,
and dim, and promising, for which their
strength has been made and their
dream dreamed.

Dark and tall in the twilight stand
the gates, with a “hail and farewell’’
to those who come and go.

THE TOWER OF THE FORREST
BUILDING

The ‘‘old red building’ has at least
one glory, its tower, from which, it is
said, nearly the whole city of Halifax
can be seen. But to those whose lives
have been bound up with it in times
past, or are bound up with it now, the
Forrest Building has a greater glory
than that. It is the glory of the
things it stands for, the glory of the
men who have laboured in it for the
advancement of knowledge, and the
glory of those who have passed through
its doors to their places in the world
outside.

But, in some ways, it seems to me
that the tower symbolizes these things,
overlooking as it does the city with its
people, overlooking it kindly and broadly, with a great wisdom gleaned from the
past, and a strong hope that foresees a
splendid future.

And perhaps it is a haunted tower,
too, for there have been many who have
loved the old building and built their
dreams around it; and when the night
comes, and the friendly stars seem not so
far above the tower to one who stands
below, perhaps their thoughts come
back to people it, who saw it in other
days, lifting its head gallantly to the
skies with the strong courage of their
Own aspirations. ;

 
  
   
   
  
   
   
   
    

 

Coming down the Avenue in the late
winter afternoon, I see ahead of me the
University gates, seeming, in the halflight, like some form of faery architecture, the Gates of Youth, perhaps.
The Cates of Youth! What else ar
they, iadeed, to those who enter them,
for all are young, and fair, and strong

lies within their bounds? The Gates of
Dreams, too! For those who have

FRED JENNINGS
HEADS MEDICAL
SOCIETY

TO HOLD BANQUET

The Medical Society held their first
meeting of the post Christmas term on
Jan. ivth. The first business to be
considered was the resignation of the
president, Ian MacDonald. This was
accepted very reluctantly by the members who regretted very much his
withdrawal from office and expressed
their appreciation of the work he did in
making this one of its most active years.
Fred jennings was unanimously elected
to fill the vacancy. In the opinion of
all he is well capable to guide the destinies of the society and keep it at its
present standard.

The annual Medical banquet ‘was
discusse1. It was decided to hold it
at the Queen Hotel between Feb.
10th and 15th. Len Miller was appointed chairman of the banquet committee.

A case of Ectopic Gestation» was
then p-esented, the different phases
being otitlined by a student from
each year. Mr. McGowan from ist
year dealt with the Embryology, after
which ir. Wood from 2nd year gave
the Histological aspect. Following this
was the Pathological Anatomy by
Mr. E. F. Ross of 3rd year. Mr.
Giddings gave the clinical symptoms
and Mr. Grant the Surgical Treatment.

The director of the station, Major
Marrett made an announcement then
concerning the Glee Club Show in the
Gymnasium on Thursday evening and
in the name of Dalhousie invited all
those interested in the college activities.
Passes and D.A.A.C. tickets should be
shown for admittance.

The programme was resumed with
the playing by the orchestra of Chapin’s
*Pracludium”’, John Budd as_ soloist
at the piano. A little bit of a dance
ended the hour.

The orchestra played the Overture
from ‘Carrie Comes to College’ and
Minnie Black, the leading lady of the
musical comedy sang the theme waltz
“There’s Music in the Air’’ accompanied
by the instruments. The only thing
we can say about this number is that if
the rest of the music’s as good as the
theme song and if the others in the cast
are as good as Minnie, its going to be a
wow. Don’t forget its going to be at
the Majestic; starting the 14th of
February.

During the evening many telephone
calls came in reporting splendid reception and one in particular was received with great gusto by those present. It was from Mr. George Guy,
President of the Wanderer’s Society
to the effect that the Wanderers could
beat Dalhousie at practically everything,
but as far as music was concerned they
would make no attempt even to rival us.
The authenticity of the latter part of
this statement is assured but as for the
beginning ! Well, we should not

These Sunday night broadcasts are
to be fairly regular and an effort should
be made by Dalhousians both at home

forget the show in ‘the Gymnasium

CHOSEN

MOOT COURT SESSIONS

Each year the students of the Law
faculty hold Moot Court. Students
of the first year act as junior counsel
to those of the second year class, whose
business it is to conduct a typical law
suit. Upon the second year student
falls the main burden of preparation and
pleading in Court. The Court, is
picked from students in their final year,
who hand down decisions in the various
cases.

Although no part of the regular cirriculum this activity is regarded by the
Faculty as of considerable importance.
In 1926 Professor Sidney E. Smith, a
former professor at the School presented
the boys with a shield as a stimulant to
endeavor.

From among the counsel of the second
year four are chosen who, in the opinion
of the Moot Court committee have
shown the greatest merit in the conduct
of their cases. This year the men
chosen were, Henry McDonald, Maurice
MacKinnon, Benjamin Guss and Gerald
Redmond.

These four gentlemen will now have
the privilege, in their final year, of
being heard in argument before a
“Bench” of Judges of the Supreme
Court of Nova Scotia, and to the one
who conducts his ease best will go the
honor of winning the coveted Smith
Shield. The shield was awarded for
the first time in 1927 when it was tied
for by Mr. A. Farmer, and A. J. Walsh.

ROOM, TEARS DOORS, |
AND WINDOWS

Special to the Gazette.
By F. W. HUSSEY
On the evening of Friday, the 11th

of ether stored in a sheet iron container
in the stock room of the Bio-Chemistry
Laboratory exploded bringing down the
plaster and scorching everything inside
the room. The door and part of the
walls and shelves were badly burned,
and the wooden covers around the
alcohol tins were completely destroyed,
although the heat failed to set off the
fifteen gallons of alcohol stored in the
cans. Imagine then what might have
been!

The inside of the stock room brought
hack memories of December 6th, 1917.
The walls blackened with smoke and
soot. All the windows cracked by the
heat, bottles, chemicals, books and
apparatus strewn all over the place.
A calendar hanging on the wall was
burned, and the charred remains hung
uselessly on the nail—a book lying
open on the desk was singed so that the
writing on the open pages was illegible,
and even papers inside the glass fume
chest were. scorched. This burning
was due to the ether fumes. Ether
vapor is quite heavy, and lies like a
blanket over a_ surface. When _ it
exploded the whole room was filled with
one sheet of flame, only for a few seconds, but long enough to scorch every

art of the room,—just as if some one

ad gone around with a match, and
set every loose paper in the room on
fire.

In an interview with Dr. Young,
head of the Department of Bio-Chemistry, he attributed the explosion to
strong acid leaking from a_ broken
bottle with unslaked lime stored on
the shalf below. This would generate
enough heat to set fire to the shelves
and cause the ether which was stored
beside the shelf to explode, and the
fumes spreading out to the main
laboratory would cause the second
explosion which blew out the heavy
oak door of the Bio-Chemistry Laboratory.

The fireman’s work was made much
more difficult than usual by the bursting of two bottles of ammonia, the
flames spread all through the rooms
and attacked the eyes and throats of
the men.

The strong acids and alkalies are
stored on a shelf above the unslaked
lime used in dehydrating grain alcohol,
and the stores of ether are kept beside
these shelves almost touching the lime,
so that any heat around the lime would
be conveyed to the ether which has a
very low boiling point.

exceptional standard, winning eleven
out of twelve debates where decisions
were given.

VII SECOND IMPERIAL CONFERENCE OF STUDENTS

The first Imperial Conference was
held in London and Cambridge England
1924 and was attended by students
from practically every part of the
British Empire. The second Imperial
Conference is to be held in Montreal
Sept. 1929. Invitations have been
addressed to the various universities in
the Empire and delegations are expected
from every part of the Commonwealth:
England, Scotland, Australia, New
Zealand, South Africa, Singapore, Hong
Kong, Trinidad, and New Foundland.
While many of the smaller possessions
promise to be represented. Every university in the Dominion has been apportioned a definite amount of money to
raise to defray the expense of this
meeting. Dalthousie’s quota is $100.00
Booklets are being prepared by the
Officers of the Federation, outlining
the details in connection with the
Conference and will be distributed in
quantities ‘to the various universities
in the British Empire. The University
of Montreal has kindly extended an
invitation to house and feed the Imperial
delegates during their stay in that city.
The City of Montreal has promised
financial assistance. The Royal Empire
Society and McGill students will contri...ute to the entertainment of the
delegates, and negotiations are under
way to obtain the distinguished patronage of His Royal Highness the Prince
of Wales and His Excellency Viscount
Willingdon for the conference. An
excellent programme has been arranged,
including addresses by outstanding
Canadian Statesmen. The “Student
Phase” of the programme will include
every topic of interest to student life.
You will see from this brief outline that
this is a big undertaking for so young
an organization as the N.F.C.US,
but the officers of the Federation are
confident that the student body throughout Canada will lend every assistance
to put the Conference ‘over’ in truly
Canadian fashion.

STUDENT TRAVEL

A great deal of good work has been
done by the officers to facilitate student
travel, especially along the lines of:
(a) Organizing student tours
Canada to other countries. (b) Receiving in Canada student groups from
other countries. (c) Furnishing information to other organizations respecting accomodation in Canada, and
furnishing information to Canadian
students desiring to travel abroad.
An attempt was made last year to

organize a group of Canadian students

to join a party travelling under the
direction of the National Student
Federation of America, but unfortunately students could not be found who were
in position to go abroad at that time.
The National Union of Students of
England and Wales has invited the
N. F. C. U. S. to organize a party of
Canadian students

With reference to the second division;

namely, receiving in Canada student
groups from other countries:—Our representatives in Toronto and Montreal

Looking back for the purpose of looking forward—one recalls

_ The Symphony Orchestra rendered a notable program at the

The Choral Society too has this year received new impetus.
The Glee Broadcast of monday was well merited: ‘“‘And the night

Energetic Sina Singer is inexhaustible in his efforts to
make Glee Club THE social contact point for all the

right that it should be so for the Glee Club is an import

A TWILIGHT THOUGHT

 

 

 

 

 

I took a handful of sunlit sand,
And wove it into a dream,

With the voice of the sea to give it song,
And your name for the theme.

As sun bows down to evening
And somber shadows fall,

Old memories come stealing,
Of days I would recall.

We live but once our lives
And cannot live them o’er;
But oft, in thought, revives
Emotion felt of vore.

And wonder-fair was the dream I made

Of the sea, and the sand, and you,

With the rapture of last year’s singing
hours.

Like a bright thread running through.

I would forget the sadness,

The unkindness, if I may;

Remembering only gladness,

And friends along the way.

And I gave it the love of my heart for
warmth,

To shelter it all the day;

But a quick, cold wind blew over the
dunes,

And swept my dream away.

NOW AND THEN ........

About this life,—they say:

“Comes back to you what you put in

With interest”’ Yes... but what if life

Refuses your deposits?

How—if, for her use,

Your gold is not the color

Or yet too heavy or too light?

And back into your lap, she tosses it

Without an explanation?

What if in her market place

You cannot buy or sell

Even if your cash be purer far

Than common currency she takes

For this or that rich blessing
bestows?

How if she will not barter with you?

Refuse to take no less than give?

And you, perforce, must keep your
offering

A thing you cannot throw away

Nor of it, make a gift? How then?

DALHOUSIE GAZETTE

LETTERS FROM SWITZERLAND —

(Being the story of a romantic love)

Staefa, October 18, 1928.
My dear friend,

This morning I went to see my old
friend and teacher Lichti. He was
much surprised when I told him who
I was and promptly wished to know
where I had been and what I had done
in all the years since we left. But I do
not believe his interest was genuine,
for I had hardly told half of the essential
events when he rushed me up to his
study to show me his books and butterfly. Poor man, the world hardly exists
outside of his study. But though well
on in the seventies he is still hale and
harty. His tall figure, his keen,
intelligent face, his abundant tufts of
white hair give him a truly professorial
aspect. And in spite of being so selfcentered he is an exceedingly interesting
man. | shall tell you more of him later.

During the afternoon I made a number of other calls. I passed twice before
Pfenniger’s house, but I neither saw
Vereneli nor her father. I had intended
to mount the stairs and boldly ring the
big brass bell, but each time I passed
my courage somehow failed me and |
went by as casually as could be, lest
Vereneli, seeing me from a_ window,
might suspect my real motive in passing
before her house. But I did meet her
before the day was done.

After supper I went down to the
shore and hired a light row-boat, equipped with a sail, from old man WKappeler.
The sun had disappeared behind the
mountain ranges across the lake as |
beached my boat on the tiny little
island half a mile up the shore and
about the same distance abreast of
Pfenniger's farm. I sat a long time on
a boulder admiring the changing colours
of the sky and the violet mists among the
lower hills. There had been a gentle
breeze blowing as I came up, but soon
it died away, even as the lights in the
sky. Sombre shadows rose from the
valleys and spread over the lake. The
stars appeared one by one until there
were millions of them, not only above
but also below, for the water was so

still the stars did not tremb!e upon it and
presented the aspect of an inverted
dome far below my feet.

For a while the silence was broke
not unharmoniously, by the soun
by a mandolin and two or three Italians
singing ‘Santa Lucia’ and “Torna a
Surriento” while rowing past the island

lake towards Staefa. After they had

hen all was still again—unusually
still. Later a dog barked over at
Pfenniger’s farm where the lights were
twinkling through the chestnut trees,
and then a man drove a wagon along the
shore road.

The distinctness of these sounds, the
clarity of the night, the great calm, and
the somewhat sultry atmosphere made
me wonder if one of those old-familiar
October storms might not suddenly
come rushing down the Siel-Thal and
stir the waters in the lake as in a cauldron. How I loved those storms when
a boy. Of thunder and lightning I had
never enough,and I went into ecstosies
of delight if a big tree crashed across the
road with thundering noise. I thought
I would enjoy one of those “good oldfashioned storms.”’

I was about to leave when I heard the
rhythmic cadence of oars striking the
water and saw a shadow gliding straight
from the shore to my little island.
Soon the boat crunched upon the sand
a few paces from where I sat, and after
a little pause someone, a woman, a
girl I thought, came towards me.
As she approached I rose, whereas,
seeing someone before her, she suddently
stopped, half suppressing a cry of
surprise. I stepped forward with a
greeting:

“Gueten abig.”

And then suddenly, before she could
answer, I had recognized the girl whom
since three days I had sought, and who
had been eluding me.

“Vereneli!’’ I exclaimed.

(The other half of this letter will be
published in the next number of the
Gazette).

 

 

 

The Editor of the Gazette.

Dear Sir:—Dr. MacMechan, with his
usual interest in students, has asked me
to write something for the Gazette
about the opportunity for doing historical research work at the Archives at
Ottawa.

Every year students and professors
go to Ottawa to consult the original
documents which are housed in the
Archives. These documents consist of
official records, treaties, correspondence
and the like. In addition to this there
is a very complete collection of books on
Canadian history in the Archives

library, and of course, a wealth of
historical relics. In my work on Indian
Design, I was able to smpplement my
reading from books from the Parliamentary library and works on Authropology and Archaeology from_ the
Geological library at the Victoria Mus
eum.

     

For the past thirty years, I have read
with amused disgust prose and poetry
laden with high flown allusions to love.
It seems that every time an asziring
poet is struck by an inspiration, he can
think of no other subject but love, and
immediately he writes a lot of rhymes
which his disordered mind considers
beautiful. This has been going on
for so long that the world has accepted
these hallucinations as truth. The
unscientific and untrained mind of the
so-called poet has cast a mysterious
mantle over a phenomenon which is a
purely mental illness.

Time and again I have wanted to
inform the world as to the real state of
affairs, but my unwillingness to dispel
a pleasant illusion has until now prevented me. But I can no longer withold
my duty to mankind.

From years of observations and study,
involving conferences with many of the
greatest scientists in the world, I can
state positively and without equivocation that LOVE IS A MANIA.
It is therefore logical to term it AMOMANIA, derived, from the Latin “amo’’
(meaning “to love’).

Amomania is a physiological process.
It is universal in character. It attachs
both old and young, male and female.
Its onset may be gradual or sudden.
The sudden type of amomania is called
love at first sight. The victims, or the
amomaniacs, then have definite symptoms which leave no doubt as to the
nature of their illness. Important symptoms of this first stage are gazing into
space, restless, insomnia, and paranoid
tendency. (Paranoid tendency being the
scientific term for false ideas of persecution). And these paranoid tendencies are associated with limitless
other delusions, all centering about the

 

 

POVERTY

 

Never smelled the smell of musk,
Or warm kisses in the dusk;

Nor heard voices in the rain

That sob against the window pane;
Nor danced under the new moon,
Or ever saw the stars at noon;
Never felt hands small and white
Lie quietly in his all night;

Nor ever woke to meet the dawn,
And found his soul’s full armour on;
Forgive him, Life, if he should sin,
For God, nowhere, has entered in.

I was able, by prudent management,
to defray my expenses by means of an
allowance of sixty dollars a month.
I was able to get this by virtue of being
added to the temporary staff of the
Archives. A limited number of students may get this allowance by applying
to Dr. Doty head of the Archives
department. A recommendation from
Dr. MacMechan is a great help.

I hope this letter will be of use to
some students. If so, they are indebted, as I am indebted, to Dr. MacMechan, for if it had not been for his
kindly interest I would never have
even known of the opportunity which
exist at Ottawa, and of course, this
letter would never have been written.

Thanking you again for your space.

Yours very truly,

object of the patients’ mania.

Incidents and happenings which ordinarily would pass by unnoticed become breatly exaggerated in the sick
mind of the patient. The kindly
glances of friends are misconstrued, and
to the abnormal state of mind of the
patient, those who glance on the object
of his mania have but one thought in
mind-—and that is to deprive him of that
object.

This first stage, which we shall term
the stage of invasion, is a most painful
one. It remains painful until the
amo-maniac transfers his infection to
his objective. As yet, science has not
isolated the amomaniac germ, but such
a germ indubitably exists.

The period of invasion has no fixed
duration. It depends entirely upon the
virulence of the initial infection. In
cases where the natural resistance is
is high, the illness may, by certain
therapeutic measures, be prevented
from performing further havoc upon the
mentality of the suffering patient.
The important factor in treatment
at this stage is to attempt to give the
patient an insight into his own condition. He should be told that the
object of his mania is merely a collection
of proto plasmic cells joined together
by connective tissue, held in place and
made to assume a human form by
osseous substances known as_ bones,
and that these cells do not function,
as he so fondly imagines, on nectar and
ambrosia, but will respond much more
readily to the higher nutritive values
of corned beef and cabbage or ham and
eggs.

If this treatment stops the sinister
cortege of symptoms we once more
have a useful and intelligent member of
society. But in case this fails, we
progress reluctantly to the _ second,
or acute stage of the malady. And
now, instead of the simple but nevertheless painful symptoms of the primary stage, we find a complete metamorphosis. From a suffering hypochondriac, our patient is transformed
into. a happy maniac. The world in
general, to his deluded mind, assumes
a rosy hue. He develops ideas of
grandeur and aspires to impossible
greatness. He becomes a happy maniac,
basking in the false glamour of his
delusions,

Another very important symptom
of this stage is the isolation complex.
To the exalted mind of the amomaniac,

isolation from the rest of the world,
with the object of his or her delusion
of affection would be a realized dream
of Paradise. In isolation they would
not have to face the hard realties of
life which are so jarring upon their
hyperaesthetic minds. This second
stage which has given rise to poetic
nonsense throughout the ages.

The termination of this stage, is most
irregular in mode. The amomaniac
will convalesce either gradually or with
remarkable rapidity. If the affection
continues, the amomaniac will undoubtedly become wedded to the
object, in which case the acute stage
may, or may not, be continued indefinitely. In case the acute stage
should terminate, society has provided
suitable laws (known as laws of divorce).

So we see that misguided rhymsters,
instead of glorifying some heavenly
quality, have in reality been uplifting
a form of mental illness. The saying
that history repeats itself is once more
demonstrated, for we all remember
the reverence accorded lunacy by the
pagan tribes of old.

Professor John M. Manly of Chicago
University was in Halifax on December
24th, as his steamer called here for a
day on the voyage from New York to
Liverpool. He and Professor Rickert
are engaged on the great task of establishing the text of the “Canterbury
Tales’. Seventy-seven MSS have been
photo-statted at a cost of $12000.
They must compare line by line, an
enormous undertaking. Professor Manly and his party were driven about
Halifax and shown the various points
of interest, such as St. Paul's and
Province House. They saw Dalhousie
and spent some time in Shirreff Hall.

_ F. Millet Salter, who has had a post
in the Department of English, Chicago
University passed through Halifax on
his way to London, on December 30.
He was a passenger in the Pennland.

He will assist Professor Manly in the
prep.

Federa‘ion of American N. S. F. A.
As sta’ed previously it was found impossible to accept the invitation last
summer to have a party of Canadian
Students join the N. S. F. A. party.
However the .Canadian debating team
will be ‘caving in Jan. 1929 to tour some
of the colleges in the N. F. S. A. and
we expect to have an N. F. S. A. team
in Canada in Jan. 1930.

The N. F. S. A. also invited a representative to attend their Annual
Congress, which was held at the University of Missouri, Dec. 12—15. Mr.
Percy Pavies our Secretary went as a

previously referred to, debated under
the au pices of the N. F. S. while in
Englan’] and Wales and we are looking
forward to another English debating
team visiting Canada in the near future.

As a member of the C. I. E. (International Confederation of Students),
the N. &. C. U.S. has taken as active
a part as its finances would permit.

From our association with these

It is felt that the work of the Federation is handicapped by the limited
financial income we possess and it is
not de2med advisable to increase the

under way to put on a campaign for the

expecte! that this movement will take
definite form following the Imperial

The success of this campaign will
mean the financial independance and

The Good Samaritan

 

If anyone had seen them standing By

the bridge railing they would have sai
“Sweethearts” or ‘‘Petters,” according
to their respective moral attitudes.
Surprisingly they were neither, though
the night being dark was peculiarly
adapted to the foolishness of lovers.
The man who had pulled this wisp_ of
girlhood from the rail and tempting
waters below now stood waiting for the
tears to subside. He thought to himself about the queerness of other people
He had never wished to commit suicide,
but then she might be crazy. With a
side glance at her he waited for any
further desperate move. As she said
nothing he decided to relieve the situation.

“Would you like something to eat-"
At his question she looked up, then
nodded slowly. ,

Once more the scene was empty of
life with only the water running its
dark laughter out to sea. i

Over the steaming coffee and inevitable chicken sandwiches she told
him the age-old story of a girl who tried
and failed. Failed because of the men
in the world, men who knew no law
but that of demand. She drew a vierd
picture of the lusiness sheik who transformed his prosaic office into an Arabian
night club. Suddenly the man felt
ashamed of his sex. He couldn’t say
anything to excuse these men but he
might do something to change her
opinion.

“I’m sorry.” Somehow the words
slipped out inane, inadequate but once
started he kept on. “I can help you
if you'd let me. You see I’m different.”
The picture of the Kiss Proof Rouge
girl smiled a trifle more cynically, or
perhaps it was the light flickering
across her painted face.

‘‘There’s my card and if you'll accept
this advance in salary I'll feel as if I’ve
helped you some and made up a trifle
for the past. My business isn't big
but I can use another girl.’”” When he

III CO-OPERATION PURCHASING

   
  

In addition to the co-operation purchasing of athletic supplies the officers
have under consideration the introduction of a similar scheme covering
scientific supplies and books.

IV. LOCAL REPRESENTATIONS

With the increasing amount of N. F°
C. U. S. work at each university it is
felt that a junior assistant should be
appointed. This not only gives the
needed help to carry on the work
efficiently, but it also supplies the
continuity essential to the best interests
of the Federation.

You will observe from this brief but
somewhat comprehensive report that
a great deal has been done since the
inception of this organization two years
ago. This was possible only by reason
of the efficiency of our officers. That
the N. F. C. U. S. has been blessed with
an unusually capable staff of officers is
apparent when one realizes the splendid
work accomplished in this short period
of time. Mr. Green our President is
not only a fine type of Canadian gentleman but he is also an excellent leader.
A graduate of Bishops and a minister by
profession, he is exceedingly well equipped to direct the affairs of the Federation.

Mr. Davies the Secretary is a brilliant
young lawyer from the University of
Alberta. He is an indefatigable worker
a true devote of the cause.

The achievements of our Vice-President, Mr. Godsoe, is familiar to all
Dalhousians, so geeds no further comment here. All the officers, needless to
say were re-elected.

The delegates are all enthusiastic in
their praise over the extremely cordial
reception and hospitable treatment
accorded them during their stay at
Kingston. Every facility in the way of
convenience and comfort was placed at
our disposal. President _Taylor received us at an afternoon tea. The
Chairman of the Board of Governors,
Mr. Nicholi entertained the delegates
at a banquet. Mr. Friend, Queens
genial representative conducted the
party around the university and provided means of transportation to the
various points of interest about the city.

In conclusion I can truly say this
has been a “labor of love’. It has been
a privilege and an honor to serve Dalhousie in this capacity and it I have
succeeded in adding any prestige to our
university at this nation wide conference, it will help in some measure to
justify the confidence reposed in me
and also to discharge a very small part
of the great debt I shall always owe my
Alma Mater.

Respectfully submitted,
CHAS. M. MacKENZIE.

their coming winter’s campaign in the

squad early in the week. — '

With nine years playing experience
in professional hockey, Matte knows
the game and is in big demand through, It wasn’t an ill wind that
blew this famous exponent of the
National winter game towards Halifax

Always popular during his active
hockey days when he played with Les
Canadiens and the Hamilton Tigers,
Matte promises to be a big favorite in
local hockey circles. He knows how to
run a hockey team how to get the best
out of his men without bullying and it is
safe to say that those who saw the

GARRICK NOTES

The coming week's performance at
the Garrick theatre holds more than
average interest for the college set.

 

' First, the play itself, ‘Common Clay”’

is the Harvard prize play by Cleves
Kinkaid. This play was the one selected by the committee of judges from the
hundreds submitted in the famous
Harvard contest. The second thing
to make it of paramount interest is the
fact that it is in this play that Mabel
Grainger will return to Halifax, playing
the leading role. This vivacious little
actress, who appeared here with Carroll
Players last season is a prime Halifax
favorite and everyone will undoubtedly
accord her a warm welcome. Other
members of the company are all well
cast in this exceptional play, which is
decidedly modern and deals with problems of life. There is a superb courtroom scene, which, while entertaining
‘to all, will particularly commend itself
to law students. All in all it is a play
ne has the stamp of approval of the
leading critics. All next week at the
Garrick theatre. Seats are now on sale
at the box office of the theatre.

officials and the promoters of last
night’s show in the gym. due to the fact
that the show was held on the same night
as a hockey game. Last year the Glee
Club conflicted with the basketball
squad and there was a big row.

Who is to blame for this last blunder?
We are informed on reliable authority
that last night’s show was originally
planned for Monday night and then
shifted until Wednesday night. The
final change found it scheduled for last
night.

However all the blame cannot be
placed at the door of the Glee Club.
We have a hockey manager and an
assistant, a athletic association and a
Students Council but no one took any
action in the matter.

Both the Glee Club and the hockey
team are going strong this year but
last night the Glee Club took all the
students. It is true that the puck chasers don’t attract much of a crowd but
they had Red for a larger following
last night than the half dozen or more
rooters who were on hand for the
initial clash of the year.

“LILAC. TIME”
HAS BIG ROLE

Acclaimed everywhere as one of the
greatest film epics ever produced,
“Lilac Time,” the Colleen MooreGeorge Fitzmaurice special production,
has been booked for a featured run at the
Casino Theatre commencing Monday.

“Lilae Time” is by all odds a great
special and the most pretentious in
which Colleen Moore has appeared to
date. Already known as the screen’s
foremost comedienne, her role in this
production establishes her on the topmost pinacle as a dramatic actress.
The tenderness, pathos and realism of
her characterization of the little French
girl makes ‘‘Lilac Time” one of the most
discussed pictures of the year and the
Casino is indeed fortunate in obtaining
such an early booking. ’

The supporting cast of “Lilac Time’
includes Gary Cooper, hero of ‘Beau
Sabreur,” “The Legion of the Condemned” and other big productions;
Burr McIntosh, George Cooper, Cleve
Moore, Kathryn McGuire, Eugenie
Besserer, Emile Chautard, Jack Stone
and many others.

be a great actor, that I could do anything. I was half-sad, whimsical, with
a queer lump in my throat—and then
I saw her.

She was standing there in just such an
insignificant corner of the room as the
one in which I stood. She looked sad,
whimsical, just the same as I did.
She was dressed in a dreamy, sky blue
creation, her blue eyes sparkling dreamily, her golden hair shining with a
bright lustre, her mouth curled contentedly.

I began to feel bold. Wherever I
got the nerve I don’t know, but I
walked brazenly up to her and asked her
to dance with me. Somehow I was
not very much surprized when she aceepted. It seemed that I felt so bold
that I knew I couldn’t be refused. So
we waltzed away, she snuggling happily
in my arms. It was the best dance that
I have ever had. Probably the best that
I ever will have. You have no idea
how I felt. For I knew that she liked
me. Else why had she consented to
dance with me, a perfect stranger?

I need not tell you what followerl.
Some more wonderful dances that
evening. A low, whispered conversation in the moonlight. Then more
wonderful evenings, more wonderful
talks, each moment spent with her
passing away all too quickly. So for
two glorious months. When I was in
love and she was in love too. For that
is what she told me during those few
golden hours.

But all things must cease. I realized
that this was too good a dream to go on
forever and after those two lovely months the end came. You know what
always happens*in those cases. Another fellow came along. He was a
handsome, dark, curly-haired chap with
a Grecian nose. It was another (for
I comfort myself with saying that ours
was the first) case of love at first sight.
She, a beautiful, dimpled, blonde,
and he a dark, Greek God. What a
great pair! I tried to comfort myself
by saying that she was happier with
him than she could ever have been with
me...........but still we had our glorious
moments.
