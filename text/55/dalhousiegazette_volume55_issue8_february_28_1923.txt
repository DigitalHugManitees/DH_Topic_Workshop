CO-ED DEBATING.

Miss Alice FE. Hunter, Arts ’23 and
President of the Delta Gamma Society
presided at the first trial debate for the
intercollegiate debating team, held in
the Munro Room on Wednesday evening last.

For obvious reasons full comment
on the speakers and the team chosen is
impossible, but it may be safely said
that there has been no trial debate conducted in Dalhousie of recent years in
which so much ability in debate has
been displayed. The subject under debate this year is ‘‘Resolved, that to
secure industrial peace in Canada, voluntary methods of conciliation, arbi
tration and mediation are preferable to

any form of compulsory legislation for
settlement of trade disputies, n. b. The
Industrial Disputes Act of 1907 is to be
regarded as a form of compulsory legislation in its application to public utilites.’’ Dalhousie upholds the affirmative and Acadia the negative side in the
debate which is to be held in March.

A majority of the judges decided that
Miss May Linton (Law ’25); Miss Olwe
Atlee (Arts ’23) and Miss Clara Murray
(Arts ’24); should form the team. Miss
Linton was appointed leader.

DELTA GAMMA NOTES.

The Delta Gamma Society held its
th fortnightly meeting at the home of
iss Jean Ross, Morris Street.

The most important question discussat the meeting was whether Delta
Gamma should have another entertainment at Glee Club. The president, Miss
Alice Hunter, read a letter from Mr.
Bethune, offering the girls another
chance for the trophy. After a little
argument it was decided to put on another show. A vote of thanks was moved to Miss Jean Ross for her kindness

history with those that have gone before. To some it means just a milestone
passed, to some others it has a peculiar
appeal because of it being their first or
last, but the great majority find in the
‘At Home”’ an intrinsic enjoyment and
satisfaction, feeling that they all have a
share.

The Pine Hill “At Home”’ is in-a
way one of the most unique social affairs
of the season. There is always the element of surprise and the programme is
so varied that all may enjoy themselves
no matter what their social accomplishments or handicaps.

Kverybody seemed to enjoy themselves. After a selection by the kitchen
orchestra one dear old lady was heard
to remark, ‘‘Why, it was music’’, The
play seemed to be much enjoyed and
the supper afterwards, which was livened by the radio announcenfents and the
lantern slides of the celebrities. The
variously decorated rooms with their
attractions, such as the museum and
swimming match, were crowded. From
half-past twelve on the boys, one by one,
came straggling in, a happy, weary
crowd .

As an aftermath of the ‘‘At Home”’
several things have come to light,, one

 

of them, however, not being Don. Sin- |

clair’s trousers. ‘‘They can have a
dozen more At Homes’’, says Don. ‘‘but

those girls won’t get in my room”.

Goudge was out all night and Bob Scott

was distressingly ill next day. He

claimed it-was due to the salad, but that.
was thrown out because Red*Grant ate

. four and had no malaise. Further, all

University

The past week at the Hall has been
one of few happenings. With the exception of the preparations for the
dance, everything has been very quiet,

With the excellent weather we have
been having, the skis have become very
popular. Every afternoon a party
starts out, and some of the boys are becoming quite expert. Some however,
have not Yet mastered all the fine points
judging from the broken skis in the
corridors. Nevertheless, the sport has
become quite the thing during the winter, and Dr. Cameron is'to be congratulated upon the enthusiasm he has stirred up.

Some of the boys, drugged from excessive reading—or looking at—‘‘Shadowland’’, have taken up art photography. Beaton and Orr are the most
successful artists up to date. Their
study of ‘‘The Sleeping Chipman’? is
a masterpiece of its kind. A flashlight
was taken just after their: subject,. overcome by too much study, had slipped
into the arms of Morpheus. The arms
of Morpheus do not appear in the reproduction. The photographers’ only explanation of this phenomena is that it
was a case of. freak photography.
Copies of this work of art may be obtained from either of the above mentioned gentlemen for the moderate sum
of fifty cents each. (This is not an advertisement). whe

The fact that time is hanging heavy
on everyone’s hands is further illustrated from the fact that several other
chaps are taking up carpentry as a hobby. Cape Breton again appears in the
van. Johnston Chew’s room is being
used as a workshop pro tem. The boys
are taking up their work.in a systematic
maner, beginning at the very bottom.
The first lessons consist entirely ‘in
nail-driving, ,

_ Friday afternoon a motor car got in —

difficulties in front of the Residence.
Always ready to do anyone a good turn,
several of the boys turned out to give
the motorist some assistance. After
some difficulty the car was cleared, and
the two leading players of the Majestic
went on their way. But not before
everyone was promised a complimentary ticket to this evening’s performance
at the Majestic. It was with some
fieulty that Miss Preston se

THE BOOKSHELF
“OXFORD AS I SEE.IT”.

Perhaps the most interesting and
entertaining book written by Professor
Stephen Leacock is one which was published last year entitled ‘‘My Discovery
of Kngland’”’. Stephen Leacock is professor of political economy at McGill
University.

This book ‘‘My Discovery of England’’, is the result of his ‘tour of England, Wales and Scotland when he appeared before the British public in the
role of lecturer. He feels that in the
past the balance of trade in impressions
has been against America; there has
been a steady stream of English travellers entering America for the sole purpose of getting impressions to carry
back to England, Leacock feels that it
is time to reciprocate and in this book
he gives his impressions of English insttiutions. In his humorous way he
compares the English customs inspector, the press reporters who interviewed him, the English audience and English universities with their American
equivalents.

The chapter which appeals most to
the student is the one entitled, ‘‘Oxford
as I see Iit’’. In this chapter Professor
Leacock gives his impressions, not only
of Oxford and its system of teaching,
but also his impressions of American
universities and the systems of higher
These impressions should
cause reflection on the part of students
‘and professors. Oxford, he proclaims,
is at the present time the greatest uni
versity in the world, It has had a great

past and a great future is also possible.

Oxford has fewer students than the °

University of Toronto. It has not the
_ rich endowments of many American uni yersities. Its methods are ators
- Applied science and modern studies are
not givena place. It has professors who

never teach and students who never

learn. Its organization is weak, Its

| eurriculum is unintelligible. But in spite

of these drawbacks Oxford trains
< ‘sdiolare of the real type better than any

is the secret. Oxford gives something to

it the closest 1s supposed to be the most
efficient. Leacock denounces this system as containing in itself the seeds of

‘destruction. It puts a premium on dull
ness and a penalty on genius. By their
present method American universities
are driving out true learning. Everything is operated on business principles
alone. The mind itself is made a mere
mechanical deviee into which a jumble
of facts are thrown and ground out when
needed at examination time. The mind
becomes. reproductive and eeases to be
creative. It is not. given a chance to
mark out a path for itself.

A university should not be merely a
degree factory. Emphasis should not
be placed on the amount of knowledge
obtained from books and lectures. The
college training which will last is that
which enables them to think things out
for himself, The real thing for a student is the college atmosphere in which
he lives; all that he really learns is that
which he learns by the active operation
of his own intellect and not what is
thrown to him im lectures and text
books. And for this active operation of
his own intellect he needs the commion
fellowship which dormitory life in eollege gives—a continued and intimate
contact with his fellows.

Professor Leacock sums up his
sentiments in these words: ‘‘If I were
founding a university—and I say it
wth all the seriousness of which I am
capable—I would first found a smoking
room; then when I had a little more
money in, hand I would found, a dormitony, then after that or more probably
with it, a decent reading room and a
library. After that, if L st still had money

over that I could not use I would hire

a professor and get some text books.
It is not the writer’s purpose to

quote Stephen Leacock as the only au

thority on the subject. But in this

chapter on college education he writes
practical common sense. Those in au
thority on, our university:

THE WILLIAM GIBSON
RESEARCH SCHOLARSHIP

FOR MEDICAL WOMEN

Miss Maud Margaret Gibson has
placed in the hands of the Royal So
-ciety of Medicine a sum of money suffi
cient to provide a scholarship of the
yearly value of £250, in memory of her
father, the late Mr. William Gibson, of
Melbourne, Australia. The scholarship
is awarded from time to time by the
society to qualified medical women who
are subjects of the British Empire; and
is tenable for a period of two years, but
may in special circumstances be extended to a third year. The next award will
be made in June, 1923

In choosing a scholar, the society
will be guided in its choice ‘‘either by
research work already done by her, or
by research work which she contemplates. The scholar shall be free to
travel at her own will for the purpose
of the research she has undertaken’’.

There is no competitive examination, nor need a thesis or other work for
publication or otherwise be submitted.
The society has power at any time to
terminate the grant if it has reason to
_ be dissatisfied with the work or conduct
” of the scholar, ;

Applications should be accompaniéd
by a statement of professional training,

- degrees or diploma, and of appoint
ments, together with a schedule of the
proposed researeh. Applications must

~ be accompanied by ‘testimionials, .one as

to academical or professional status,.
‘and one as to general character. Kn
a -  yelopes containing applications, etc.,

 

- should be marked on top left-hand corner, ‘‘William Gibson Research Schols Mgahin”® and should eb sci to Sir

members, and even yet information regarding the organization is somewhat
vague. It was during a heated meeting
quite recently that voices were raised to
great heights—all five waxed eloquent—
frequent references to the constitution
were made and we gleaned the following clause out of the turmoil ‘‘Should
any member be caught in a public eating place witht a lady, by any of the other
members, it shall be their privilege to
eat their fill and pass the cheque to the
less fortunate member’. Our sympathy went to the poor unfortunate who
having been caught twice the previous
week, was begging that the clause be
amended or that a commission for the
control of appetite be appdéitited.

But there was a counter attack. It
seems the constitution did. not cover the

case of two offenders in Blakley’s at 
one time, and ‘‘Fluckie’’, arriving with
a fair lady, finds ‘*Dukie’’ exchanging
compliments with a lady friend. Hastily Pluck ordered, ate with great speed,
touchingly presented the Duke with the
cheque and fled. It was at this stage of
the meeting that Melsaac rose and
soaring to the heights of eloquence begged protection from the big fellow, recommending—then one of the listeners

“Class °26 Feed.”

Shortly after 4.30 on Wednesday
afternoon, February 21st, the Freshettes began to assemble at the Murray
Homestead. Many and various weré
the things they carried, but all possessed on characteristic—edibility. |The
‘‘bar-room’’ was an animated place for
the next hour—cake being cut, oranges
sliced, cream whipped, and the wonderful fruit salad vigorously stirred.

Promptly at 6 o’clock thirty-two
hungry girls seated themselves at the

long tables, decorated with streamers of
black and gold.

The menu included hot
scallops, sandwiches in unhmited abund
ance, cake, fruit salad, tea and coffee.

Several speeches were much enjoyed
with the dessert.

After the supper those shy young
Freshettes who say they cannot dance
were given a compulsory lesson in the
Terpischorean art. aney: seemed to
enjoy it.

The dishes having been washed: —the
ablative absolute is undoubtedly the
pleasantest construction to put on this
task—the girls dug out their coats and
departed. The out-of-town girls were
each made happy by a present of cake
and sandwiches left from the feed, and
went on their way rejoicing,

Thanks are due to Mrs. Sykes’ Loe: he

her kind assistance in many details, and
to the energetic vice-president and social committee, who manages
‘‘feed’’ so capably. K

THE DALHOUSIE GAZETTE

CLASS ’26 DANCE”

One evening not long ago the Green
Lantern ‘was the scene of a hilarious
function held by the verdant freshmen.
Part of the room was occupied by
tables, so that those who wished could
play cards and games, but nearly all
took advantage of Johnny Thurrott’s
wonderful music. (Doug assisted with

 

 

the saxophone).

The hall was artistically decorated
with banners and the relics of the
Junior-Senior dance. Did any one say
confetti balloons? One corner was
decorated by the punch bowl—contents
of said decoration being extremely
popular. Among the novelty dances
were a heart dance, a leap year dance
(did anyone say the Freshettes were
slow ?), a serpentine, a blindfold grab
dance, several cut-ins,—and supper.

Mrs. Murray Macneill charmingly
and ably chaperoned the party, but
Professor Macneill was otherwise engaged in the Bathurst Curling Rink.

The committee responsible for the
event worked diligently against odds to
make it a success, and they certainly
succeeded, The class officers are:

President—Gordon MacOdrum.
Vice-President—Edith Macneill.
Secretary—Hazel Pearson.
Treasurer—Byron Johnstone.

Charlotta Johnson, Gordon Graham,

Dalhousie Defeats St. F. X.
At Truro

In spite of. protests, inter-collegiate
rulings, and some other handicaps Dalhousie again defeated St. F. X. by a
score of 3-2 at Truro, on Thursday, Feb.
23.

On account of Seldon’s sudden illness after his arrival in Truro, Creighton was forced to act as substitute for
Hickey. and Langwith throughout the
game, while Haslam, Fluck and Morrison played whirlwind hockey during the
entire sixty minutes without relief.

The first period ended in a score of
1-0 in favor of St. F. X. as a result of
Brown banging the puck past Mclsaac
from a mix-up in front of the Tigers’
net. |

~ In the second period Haslam went
into the forward line and from then until the end of the game the fans had an
opportunity of witnessing some ‘ast
hockey. After ten minutes of play in
this period Hickey evened the score for
Dal. with a nice wing shot, but Brown
after. repeated attempts again put his
team in the lead by shooting a hot one
past the ‘‘Duke’’ just before the gong
sounded.

Three minutes after the beginning
of the third period Fluck made a beautiful rush and passed to Haslam who
tied the score for Dal. From then until
the end of the game the fans were ‘in an
uproar. With only five minutes to go
Morrison secured the rubber in front of

the St. F. X. net and slipped it past
- Ryan for Dal’s winning tally. The St.
-F. X. goalie made some wonderful

saves, and’as usual, “‘the Duke’’ was
‘there with everything necessary.

Basketball

A Few Powts Players Should Know.

(Continued. )

Short Shots or shots near the basket, must be made fast, and they differ
from the long shot. More ‘‘English’’ is
used, as well as the back-board. The
player should take advantage of his
height, releasing the ball at the highest
point of the jump. Practice close-in
shooting from all angles and positions,
coming in on the run, receive the pass,
locate the basket, jump high and short,
making the goal practice as near like
game conditions as possible, with two
or three men working ball. towards the
basket, one man shooting and getting
away fast, while the other two get into
position for a rebound.

Foul Throwing is an important factor in winning games, The throw should
be high, the ball striking the back-board
as it descends with some ‘‘Knglish’’
on the ball. Players should practice
foul throwing at regular periods, stepping out of the circle between shots.

Dribbling can be used to advantage
at times, but a dribble should never be
used when the player can pass. A good
dribbler is likely to break up team
work, by trying to advance in that manner everytime he gets possession of the
ball. Few men ever become proficient
enough to make dribbling effective
when used continually. |

Dal Girls At Mt. A.

Mount Allison Girls’ Basket-Bau
Team defeated the Dalhousie Girls in
their new gymnasium on Thursday last
by a score of sixteen to ten. The reason
of the defeat if a reason can be found
was the excellence of the Mt. A. team
and the fact that the Dal. girls seemed
to he at the ‘‘fag sal” nada ae
