HALIFAX, N. 8., FEBRUARY 14, 1923

tral organization for the service of each
institution’’,

It is most complimentary to the local
leaders in this great project that their
scheme of organization, prepared in
committee several months ago, should
be unanimously confirmed by the Carnegie Corporation. In the original report of the investigators of our educational system there was no arbitrary attempt made to indicate the way in
which federation should be accomplished, The detailed plan of union or merger was left to the colleges concerned.
In consequence a tentative plan was
drawn up at the December conference,
in which it was expressly stated that
the plan was not binding upon any of
the colleges, and this plan was submitted to the Foundation, At that time
the deliberations were hampered by a
meagre knowledge of the support which
might be forthcoming from the sponsors
of the federation. Their latest announéemerit meets this difficulty and
following such a generous offer the
scheme of University Federation should
make rapid strides towards the goal of
perfect understanding and ultimate
union.

DR. HERBERT GREY.

Definite announcement has _ been
made that Dr. A. Herbert Gray, the
most outstanding student leader in the
world today, will visit Dalhousie from
March 38 to 8, 1923.

DEBATING TEAM SELECTED

On Wednesday evening last, at the
School for the Blind, the team that will
represent Dalhousie in the approaching
debate with Acadia was definitely decided. Messrs. L, W. Fraser, (leader),
W. 9. Gilchrist and Don. McInnes have
the honor and responsibility of upholding the enviable reputation of this uni
versity in debating circles. The out- —

standing ability of these speakers, who
are too well-known in every phase of
college activity to necessitate any comment here, is such that their fellow students may rest assured that they will
bring honor to themselves and to their
Alma Mater in the forthcoming debate
with the redoubtab!e Acadia men.

The

high standard. The speakers, to a man,

presented their cases without a falter,”

in a manner that would do credit to
veterans.

W. 8S. Gilchrist who led the afiiiieins
tive opened the argument and was. well
supported by his colleagues, W. H.
Swan and Don. McInnes. The-negative
was upheld by J. H. Forbes and Robert
F’. Ross under the leadership of L. W.
Fraser.

The presence of Dr. McMechan, the
chairman, added greatly to the dignity —

Like all Gaul, Sir Henry Newbolt’s
message to the people of Halifax was
divided into three parts.

The first part was delivered to the
student body of Pahoa The third
part, however, which was aNnore interesting lecture, was heard by very few
of the college students.

The lecture on ‘‘Poetry and Patriotism’? was an intellectual treat for the
mature mind, while the lecture on
‘The Future of the English Language’”’
was of a more popular nature. Now
the mind of the undergraduate is in a
receptive state, The soil is fertile, but
nevertheless some seeds will grow better than others. In view of these facts,

- jt seems that the last lecture might have

been more appropriately delivered to an
audience whose future and influence 1s
yet in the making.

On the following Sunday evening
Sir Henry delivered a lecture at the Majestic Theatre, which got a much more
comprehensive reception. Perhaps the
thoughts were correlated to a greater
extent, and thus easier to follow than on
the previous day, or perhaps the literary sense of the audience was more
highly developed than that of the students. Whatever the cause, the result
was a particularly satisfactory one.
The whole audience followed every
word, and derived the greatest possible
enjoyment during the hour.

The lecture was a plea for the use
of the Bible in-the study of literature.
Sir Henry dwelt at some length on the
Bible as a model of style. It contains,
as he pointed out, the deepest thoughts
of life expressed in the simplest language of our century. In fact the very
charm of the Bible lies in its simplicity.

It was not until the third lecture,
however, that Sir Henry appeared at
the top of his form, as he would say.
Those who were able to hear him at the
Navy League Building, spent one of the

most enjoyable evenings of their lives.

From the opening remarks of the

‘‘ninch-hitter’’? chairman, Professor
scat, till Sir Henry completed the

reading of some of his poems, the audience literally sat on the edge of their
seats, drinking in the flow of words.
The lecture was indeed ‘‘the gem in his

Sir Henry Newbolt’s Visit To Halifax

direct his shafts against himself and
his countrymen, showed his sense of
humor to be of the first water.

Using as his starting point, a bit of
slang let fall by the chairman, ‘Sir
Henry passed from the present into
the past of our language. He traced
the metamorphosis of the Latin language
down to its present forms, and drew
the possible analagy in respect to the
English language. He pointed out
where, in some instances, the changes
were becoming apparent already, But
nothing was being done to stop it. No
efforts for preservation were being
made, such as the French employ. Keeping our language pure was one of his
hobbies, but it was a hobby in which he
had very few active supporters.

Looking to the future, the prospects
were not of the best. In the United
States in fact, an attempt was being
made by Professor Mencken and others
to build up an American language
which should be quite distinct from the
English tongue. This attempt, however, was being counteracted by the
labor of Americans of greater foresight.
Here such a man as Brander Matthews
was in the van.

In concluding, Sir Henry bemoaned
the fact that a language so well adapted
for all purposes, should thus lose its
efficiency. But in view of present conditions, he feared the trend was in t
direction. To arrive at the paradoxical
situation of possessing a perfect knowledge of science, but without a language
to express that knowledge would be

awful,

At the end of the lecture, it was announced that Sir Henry would return
to England by way of Halifax. Notwithstanding first impressions, every
undergraduate of the University should
make it a point to hear him on his return, which will be about rt 7

CARNEGIE GIFT TO
UNIVERSITY LIBRARY

The University Library is much indebted to the Carnegie Endowment for
Interantional Peace, of Washington,
D. C., for many books of exceptional
value to the student of international
Affairs.

Perhaps the most interesting books
of the gift. collection are those listed in

The International Mind Aleove. An- —

other notable series deals exhaustively
with economic issues of the World War.

To the general reader, such books as ©

‘Mysterious Japan’’ by Julian Street;
‘‘Red Dusk and the Morrow’—a fascinating account of life in Bolshevist Russia, by Sir Paul Dukes, and ‘* Ambassador Morgenthau’s Story will have an irresistable appeal,—already they are in
constant demand.

Among the latest additions are
‘‘Neighbors Henceforth’’, by Owen Wister; ‘‘Wise Men from the Hast and
from the West’’ by A. M. Rithbany, and
“The New Latin America’’ by Jacob
Warshaw. The classical student will
find a particular interest in the little
volume edited by R. W. Livingstone entitled ‘‘The Legacy of Greece.”’

It is impossible to exaggerate the
service which the Carnegie Endowment is rendering. Dalhousians who
have perused any considerable portion
of the collection are convinced the University Library is greatly enriched by
these generous’ gifts.

(The Gazette here takes the-opportumity of expressing Dalhousie’s gratitude for these valuable gifts.—Ed.)

THE “MAID” AGAIN

By special request the Glee and
Dramatic Club presented ‘‘The Yokohama Maid’’ at Camp Hill Hospital on the
evening of February 5th for the benefit
of the patients and their friends.

The complete cast and full orchestra
were present, and judging from the en
thusiasm of the audience this, the third

presentation of the comic operatta, was

up to the standard of the other per
formances.

“THE SIX.HUNDRED”.
(While Pine Hill Preaches).

Sunday he brought out all the Delta O’er their devoted heads

Gamma invitations to Pine Hill. Where
or how he got them is a mystery, when
interviewed by our representative he
but smiled knowingly and offered no
explanations. The top floor is again the
most popular in the residence, no less
than nine invitations being received.
Five of this same floor appeared in
dress suits. The burden of their song
was, ‘‘Not a cent, not a cent and my
clothes are only lent.’’

And the depths to which some of the
boys sank in order to obtain an invitation—Jigger Grant had to go so far as
to ask one of the lady theologues to secure him one,

Our chess team played a return game
with the city chess club on Tuesday
night and tied with them. This is really a remarkable showing and the boys
deserve credit.

Pine Hill was the Mecca for skaters
on Wednesday and Thursday of last
week, The ‘‘Arm”’ in front was just like
a mirror and everybody took advantage
of it. Numerous little parties were
formed in the residence, the most famous being that of J. P. C. whose whistle
brought the youth and beauty of Dalhousie, past and present, around him.
And the old halls of Pine Hill were
ashamed when they were forced to shelter the unusual scene of girls putting on
and See their skates and indeed a wept when even the freshmen took their girls within.

‘*Button, button, whose got the button’’ is Jigger Grant’s latest diversion.
‘So enthused became some of the boys in
the game that when Jigger went to go
to the Junior-Senior there wasn’t one
on his dress suit. It was certainly a
delicate situation but a paper of pins
fixed him up for the evening although
the night was one of agony and impending disaster. However, a letter from
his little girl in Cousin Prmrose’s cor
ner took his mind off the inhumanity of
his fellowmen. |

  
  
 

While the Law thundered,
Snugly and heedlessly
Snored the six hundred.
Strong was the preacher’s theme
Turned on was all his steam,
Neither with shout nor scream
Could he disturb the dream

Of the six hundred.

’

Still with redoubled zeal,
Still he spoke onward,
Shouted in wild appeal!
Struck with both fist and heel!
Making the pulpit reel
Shaken and sundered,
Called them the Church’s foes;
Threatened with endless woes:
Feebly the answer rose—
Proofs of their sound repose—
From the united nose

Of the six hundred.

THE QUEBEC BRIDGE

_ Professor Copp recently gave an
interesting and instructive lecture on
the Quebec bridge before the engineering society. At the beginning of his lecture he gave a brief outline of the history of bridges from those of Babylon
and Rome to these of the present day.
The Quebec bridge, he said, is not especially noted for its length, because
there are longer bridges in the world.
But in one thing it is unsurpassed and
that is the length of its unsupported
span. This span extends eighteen hundred feet, a distance equivalent to that
from the Majestic to the City Hall, and
is the longest unsupported span in the
world.

The construction of this bridge was
first undertaken in 1907, but when partly constructed it collapsed, and seventy-five men went with it to their deaths.
A hundred thousand dollars was spent
on ‘experiments and plans for the new
bridge and finally tenders were called
for. A Canadian company undertook
the building of the bridge a short time
before the War, and: continued despite
hardship and accident until they finall
ly completed it in 1917. It was officially opened by the Prince of Wales during
his visit to Canada in 1919, =

University Hall

Our local Anzac, one Brophy, has
recently stepped into the public eye,
Although studying medicine, one of his
particular hobbies is furniture moving.
Only last week he was doing a little job
for Clarence Morrison (room-mate of
the famous Sheik). Clarence says he
can recommend the careful handling received by the chairs in particular. Mr.

Brophy ’s accomplishments are not
limited to this line, He is also a marvellous footballer and boxer. He has a

failing for Canadian cheese, but his
his taste in trousers is not to be recommended. Jos Ashkins says so.

The popular gym. instructor, Mr.
Sterling, who lives at the Hall, has discovered that he has a rival in the person of Hric (Bricky) Dunn. Brick’s
only pupils to date are Dand and Somers, but their training is progressing
rapidly. The course of instruction ¢onsists in lessons in boxing and sprinting—in the order named. The trainer
says it is remarkable that such talent.
was never discovered before. Practices
are being held weekly.

The billiard tournament has now
reached the semi-finals. Everyone is
glad to see Art, Hull, the last handicap
champion, as one of the four players,
The appearance of the other three in
the semi-finals, "however, was unsuspected. KF. Lawrence Moore is a newcomer in the indoor sport. Dr. R. M.
Dawson is a shining example of the old
proverb that practice makes perfect.
The defeat of Eddie Bayer by Henry
Borden was quite a surprise. Borden
claims that his win was due entirely to
the’ support of his room-mate, who
‘“twa-twa-twahed’’ him on to victory.

| A.C. M,

STOP PRESS—Latest reports are to the ef- ~
fect that by defeating “Dinty” Moore after the
latter had forced Hull out of the running, Henry
Borden has won the tournament, He is now eutitled to have his name “immortalized of the Silver
Shield”,

Moral Value of Greek Music.
The Greeks received much of their
music from Asiatic and Egyptian
sources, but they received it with discrimination. Henceforth music was no
longer to be the concern only of priests
and warriors; but it was to be set before the world as the worthy and honorable pursuit of free men with free minds.
The whole of Greek music is intimately bound up with the sung poetry,
which was popular in Greece from re
motest times. These chanted poems are
mentioned even by Homer, and were of
two kinds—dramatie and non-dramatic
—hboth forms, however, being just as
clearly musical as poetic.

It is interesting to note that Greek

writers were all agreed that music had
a serious moral value. They did not say
vaguely, as we do, that music was a
beautiful thing and had an ennobling
effect on the human mind. On the contrary they said that, according to the
way in which it was written, it was actually good or bad; that it had a definitely
good or bad influence on the development
of personal character; and that therefore the musical means employed was a
matter of the greatest concern to educationists and statesmen.

The moral character, which they regarded as inherent in the art, was called
the ‘‘ethos’’ of music. Its value to society in general was known as its ethical
value. Philosophers differed in explaning why there was an ‘‘ethos’’ in music;
they differed also in discussing its practical application; but none of them: ever
dreamed of disputing its existence.

At the present time, of course, people .

agree that ‘‘good music”’ is better than

‘Shad music’. But that was not the
3 Greek attitude at all. Their constant
subject of discussion was whether this
mode or that mode was better suited for
| incu'eating this or that form of moral
} excellence.
HK On the dramatic side, the Greek
| lyrics began with the singing of the.
| ‘‘dithyramb”’’, a loud choral-song chanted to a circular dance in honor of the
A wine-god Dionysius. Starting from that,
the leading singer improvised a narra' tive, and the improvisation in time developed into tragedy. Similarly from
i the phallic processions of the country' __ gide and coarse jestings of vine dressers
as they carried their barrels into the
| __ villages, came comedy.
pei On the non-dramatic side the lyrics
were either hymns to the gods or purely
secular songs—thanksgivings for har_. vest, paeans of victory, marriage cha
- and funeral dirges. An internation
-__ gort of lyric was the rustic lament for

  

Os.
i Thus music placed as great, if not a
‘more important part in determining the
moral standards of the Greeks than did

GIFTS TO THE MUSEUM

Through the kindness of Dr. Lewis
Hunt of Richmond, England, Dalhousie Museum has obtained a number of
very interesting Greek terra cottas of
the 5th-century, B. C. They were unearthed by Mr. Douglas Sladen, in the
ruins of Selinunte, Sicily. They consist
of small vases, lachrymatories, antique
lamps, and heads of figurines. They
have all been identified and labelled.

It is proposed to have a department
of the museum devoted to the wooden
ship building of Nova Scotia, and a beginning has already been made. Mr.
North of Hantsport has donated three
fine models of vessels built by his firm,
namely, the bark ‘‘ Loadiana,’’ the barkentine ‘‘Grenada,’’ and the brigantine
‘‘Quracoa.’’ Mr. Thomas Anderson of
Windsor has presented a fine model of
the famous yacht ‘‘America,’’ made by
himself from the specifications of that
vessel. Mr. W. A. Black has given the
model of the full-rigged ship ‘‘Avon’’,
built to scale by Mr, Robert Redden of
Windsor. The ‘‘Avon’’ was built at
Newport Landing from a tea-clipper
model sent out from London, and made
a record voyage to Hongkong and Ceylon but never returned to Nova Scotia
after launching.

It is hoped that friends of the University and those interested in the great
story of Nova Scotia shppng, will make
other contributions. Pictures, models,
data, of all kinds relating to this vanished industry will be most acceptable.

OLASS ’24 NOTES.

On Thur., Feb. 8th, the Juniors held
a stormy meeting in Room 4 of the Arts
Building. The principal bone of contention was a class function and the
mode of conducting the same.

It was unanimously decided to have
a sleigh-drive, and many words were
used by some members in their suggestions, and many more by others in their
approval or disapproval of the aforementioned suggestions. All was settled
amicably, however, and they. expect to
enjoy the outing on the evening of
Thursday the 15th.

Messrs. LeBlanc, Folkins, Gulliver
and Winning, of Pharmacy have returned from St. John, where for the last
week they have been engaged in writing the N. B. Pharmaceutical Society
examinations. |

The Law Society pin recently made
its first appearance. A small circular
face with the name of the Society on it,
in silver and black enamel, makes a very

MOCK PARLIAMENT

With all the customary formalities
the 1923 session of the Mock Parliament of the Law School was opened by
His Excellency Governor-General
Richard Anthony MacLeod last Thursday evening. After an exciting campaign, free from personalities and with
keen contests in all constituencies, the
Liberals found themselves entrusted
with the reins of power, and the Leader,
J. F. MacNeill, immediately set about
the task to form the Cabinet.

On Thursday evening, after Ronald
M. Fielding, B.A., LL.B., ex-Premier of
the wbeiament had been elected Speak
the House, the Gentleman Usher of
the Black Rod, who turned out to be
Charlie Baxter in disguise, announced
that His Excellency desired to address
the honorable members, =~

Dressed with all the regalia of his
exalted office the ‘‘Judge’’ made an excellent Governor-General and in clear
tones read the Speech from the Throne.
After performing this function he retired to the Chateau. Immediately the
house set to work. The pro forma bill,
about which no more is heard, was introduced by the Minister of Agriculture, Hon. J. Fleming (Colchester).

Harrison Goodwin, M. P. for Westmoreland, moved the address in reply
to the Speech from the Throne and
made an excellent impression. He is a
speaker of courage and dealt with the
Speech in an altogether creditable manner, The motion was seconded by E. L.
Cross (Gaspe), who spoke in French,
his native language, and during the
course of his remarks paid eloquent
tribute to the old Liberal chieftain. The
member of Gaspe, like so many from
the province of Quebec, attained heights
of oratory and made a splendid speech.

Following the mover and the second
_er the leader of the official opposition,

J. Francis Mahoney (Halifax), addressed the house and with caustic sarcasm
wrenched the Speech from head to foot.
Mr. Mahoney, who entered the house in
the days of Sir Charles Tupper, uses to
advantage that flow of oratory characteristic of the Irish. ‘‘Sentence by
sentence, and word by word’’, he
brought home his points with trenchant
emphasis and telling effect. He ‘was
ably supported by another son of Brin,
the member from Devil’s Island (G. F.
Flavin), who congratulated the previous
speakers, the Premier, the Bredker,

and referred most gracefully to the apfi oe mer of

the new Governor-GenMr, Flavin did not f the

his group with respect to the questions
of immigration and matters of vital
concern. He declared that the attitude
of that group was not to pledge support to the government or to obstruct
measures of a beneficial nature which
might be introduced, but like its predecessors it would maintain a policy of
benevolent neutrality. He spoke feelingly of the loyal support of his followers and of their personal qualifications to sit in the house, representing
as they do every class in Canadian life.

The Premier, in addressing the
house, made clear that much had been
purposely left out of the Speech from
the Throne, and that during the session
many measures affecting the welfare of
the country would be introduced for the
consideration of the house. He complimented the mover and seconder of
the reply and the speakers of the other
groups in the house.

On the motion being put the government was sustained by a straight party
division, the Progressives declining to
vote. The Clerk of the House, J. G.
Fogo, announced 25 ‘‘Yeas’’ and 12
‘*Nays’’.

The bills given theeir first reading
and their sponsers were as follows:

A bill respecting Immigration, Hon.
D. MeGeer (Victoria) ;

A bill calling for the Improvment of
Conditions of Laborers in Dalhousie
Law School, Hon. J. K. Hackett (Cape
Breton North) ;

A bill for the development of Agriculture, Hon. J. Fleming (Colchester) ;

A bill to provide for the financial
expenditures of the current year, Hon.
A, M. Matheson, Minister of Finance
(Montreal) ;

A bill respecting the course in
Hoc ya Solicitor-General Hickey Haliax) ;

A bill respecting an amendment to
the Industrial Disputes Act, C. 8. Richardson (C. B, South).

On motion of the Premier the house
was adjourned till February 15th.

Hric Jerret was Sergeant-at-Arms
and J. R. MacDonald, Assistant Clerk.

sé
OUR CANADIAN LITERATURE.”

‘Selections of Representative Prose
and. Verse, Chosen by Albert Durant
Watson and Lorne Albert Pierce. The
Ryerson Press, Toronto,

In a small volume issued from the
Ryerson Press is contained a new Cana
diaff anthology; and rarely indeed is

such a delectable feast afforded to Canadians. Even the most casual reader
finds within himself a response to Mr.
Watson’s words in introduction: ‘It is
our duty to see that our native Art is
not lost in obscurity, Some jewel of Canadian song not yet fully appreciated may
be saved... .through the recognition bestowed upon it by the very least of us.’

An urgent patriotic duty is in thig
case an unmitigated pleasure. Canada
sings! Her pure and young voice is
raised in pride of strength and beauty.
No blindly ardent patriotism need force
the eye along the page—whether the
book be opened on prose or verse, it is
the charm of poetry that binds us in its
spell. ‘‘Our ipurpose is not to glorify
our country but to serve her,’’ avow the
editors,—it may well be that they are
destined to splendid success in the accomplishment of both these desiderates!

In the section devoted to verse
friends old and new appear. Bliss
Cameron, D. C. Scott, C. G. D. Roberts,
Archibald Lampman, Marjorie , Pickthall—what a creditable list has Canada
already! But there are other voices,—
Robert Norwood, John Daniel Logan,
Arthur Stringer, John McCrae, Arthur
S. Bourinot, Isabel Keclestone MacKay,
and scores of less famed makers of
music not less beautiful. ' |

The prose section gives evidence of
a pains-taking care in selection under
guidance of a rare taste for what is of
lasting worth. No better proof of the
existence of a true Canadian literaure
could be offered than is here displayed.

Sir Gilbert Parker, Sir Wilfred Laur
ier, Louis Hemon, Agnes OC. Laut, Joseph Howe, T. C. Haliburton, Stephen
Leacock—all these and dozens no less
worthy are called upon. Dalhousians
will note with particular pride Dr. Arch
ibald MeMechan’s beautiful deseription .

of Annapolis Royal. James deMille’s
‘‘Strange Manuscript’’ has also been
levied upon and Dr. Logan delineates
incisively ‘‘Genuine Democracy’’.

The Gazette recommends this book
very heartily not only to Dalhousians
but to all lovers of what is best in literature. ) |

He drank from her lips the nectar,
_ A's under the moon they sat, —
And wondered if any other guy,
Had drunk from a mug like that,

Crescents Wi

Crescents Outplayed Tigers
By 7—38 Score.

Last Tuesday night, Feb, 6, at the
Arena, the Crescent hockey team made
a@ surprising and decisve come-back,
when they reduced Dalhousie’s sextette
from their position as City League leaders and put tthe city contest, at least
temporarily, into a three-cornered tie.

The Half Moons outclassed the
Tigers at combination during most of
the game, and.Hallisey and Ahern at
defense found little difficulty in stopping Dal’s attacks, most of which were
brilliant but individual.

McKenna showed up well for the
Gold and Black at the beginning of the
game, but appeared to fire rather
quickly.. Bates, Haslay and Dunlop,
especially the last, played dazzling
hockey. If any one may be said to have
starred for the Varsity it was Dunlop,
whose good work showed more result
in the score column than that of any of
his team mates.

Goals were scored as follows:

First period: Creseents 2, Dal 1.

Second period: Crescents 3, Dal 2.

Third period: Crescents 2, Dal 0.

The line-up :—

Crescents—Goal, Hurley; Defense, Hallisey, Ahern; Forwards, Winters,

T. Radford, H. Radford, McDonald,

Butler, Mellish.

Dalhousie—Goal, MeclIsaac; Defense,

Fluck, Dunlop; Forwards, Bates,

Haslam, McKenna, Dunn, Morrison.

SPORT AMONG DALHOUSIE
COEDS.

At present basketball rules in the
sporting world of the co-eds. The candidates for the first and second teams
are working hard under the competent
guidance of Mr. Sterling, the gymnasium instructor. |

Dalhousie has a great deal of good
material this year. especially for the
forward line, and this year’s team promises to be even better than the champion team of last year.

Mount Allison, Dalhousie. and Acadia constitute the league this year,
King’s having dropped out. The schedule has not yet been drawn up, but it is
being arranged so that the date of the
final match will be as near as: possible
to the date of the Dalhousie-Acadia In
- tercollegiate Girls’ Debate. This will

mean that the first game will be played
about February 20. ;
An inter-class league was forined be
fore hristmas, but so little interest

the Co-eds occasionally play badminton
and indoor baseball. Mr. Sterling also
has a class in gymnastic dancing.

Basketball

A Few Powts Players Should Know.

The basketball season is at its height,
and in gymnasiums throughout the country, thousands of girls, men and boys
are playing this game, in some fashion.
The idea of the inventor of basketball, was to develop an indoor game simply to fill in during the winter season.
From this beginning the game has
grown to ‘such proportions that it now
classes as one of the leading winter
games, and a great deal of progress has
been made in its development, due in a
great measure to the intensive work of
the Y. M. C. A. and colleges.

Every girl, man or boy who has visions of being a good performer at some
future period, will find the following
fundamentals very useful.

GoaL THROWING.

This is beyond any doubt the most
important phase of this game. Players
should shoot deliberately at first, striving for accuracy rather than speed.
After the player develops his eye for the
basket, he can speed up his shots.

Long Shots. In long shots the throw
should always be aimed high, striking the
back-board as the ball descends with
very little ‘Knglish’’ on the ball. Practice long shots from every position on
ithe floor. Take a step forward and jump
into the air alighting on one or both
feet, ready to follow in.

The push shotisthe most commonly
used in shooting long shots; hold the
ball about chest high in both hands;

thumbs and fingers just above the cen
tre of the ball. As the arms are thrust
forward, and jump into the air, releasing the ball at the height of the jump,
with a slight inward twist with the fingers. The ball strikes the back-board as
it descends and player follows in for
rebound.

The bounce pass is a good and very
hard to intercept if used at the right
time. Wait until the guard comes in
close, then snap the ball toward the
floor, under the opponent’s guard. Good
judgment must be used for time and
position of player to receive the ball. A
break. is. sometimes used to advantage
with this pass.

Wanderers Win Championship
And Brister -"e

Wanderers basketball teafn are City
League Champions for 1922-23. This is
the second time in three years that the
Redshirts have won the title and ‘the accompanying Brister trophy.

The win was clean cut and decisive
for in spite of stiff opposition the phenomenal shooting of ‘‘Chick’’ McLeod
and Ritchie MacCoy resulted in substantial scoring margins in both halves of the
game.

In the first period the same amazing lethargy was in evidence that has
been responsible for several of Dalhonusie’s previous defeats this year. The
second period saw distinct improvement
—strenuous checking, faster play and
better shooting, and the final seore of
this session was only 19-16 in the Wanderers’ favor.

Muir, Wilson and MacOdrum were
high scores for Dalhousie. Grant, the
big Dal. centre, had an ‘‘on”’ night and
worked in on several pretty assists in
addition to doing a little scoring of his
own.

The team missed Ivan Mader, star
forward. Mader is in hospital, to the
great regret of team-mates and admirers.

THE ‘‘JUNIOR-SENIOR’’.

The annual Junior-Senior dance took
place at the gymnaium, Studley, on
Friday, February 2nd, Mr. and Mrs.
G. Fred Pearson and Miss Marian
Hoben, Vice-President of 1924, received the guests in the Gym, which had
been transformed for the oceasion by
the effective use of black and gold
streemers, festooned, tent fashion, from
the beams, and rainbow-hued balloons,
swinging like Japanese lanterns in long
tines across the room.

The central ‘‘motif’’ was the ‘‘ Welcome, 23’’ beneath a festoon of gold and
black bunting with the class shield in
the centre. Dalhousie banners decorated the walls and four large ‘‘D’s’’
gave a very striking effect. In different corners of the room the class pin
stood out prominently.

The musical programme was furnished by the Harmonic orchestra, and
in addition there were several novelty
dances, namely, the ‘‘Balloon’’ and
‘‘Serpentine’’ dances, also a ‘‘surprise
package’’ dance.

An innovation were the ‘‘radio ex- . |

tras’’. These were due to the courtesy
of the Marconi Co. and the co-operation
of the Radio Engineers, Ltd.

One of the ‘‘hits’’ of the programme
was the solo ‘‘Suki Tong’’, sung by Mr.
Andreas Johansen. The welcome to
1923 was given by Max Cassidy and responded to by Cliff. Grant, President
of ’23, in an appropriate spirit’’.

Junior Senior was a Dalhousie
dance in the truest sense of the word,
given in a place with Dalhousie atmosphere and surroundings, and it has
Mr. Pearson was
heard to say that he was delighted to
think that the Gym had been utilized
for a Dal dance.

The committee in share of the arrangements was composed of. Misses
Marian Hoben and Hsther MacKay,
and Messrs. Max Cassidy, Charlie
