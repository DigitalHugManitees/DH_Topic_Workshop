W hy Shirreff Hall Girls

Prefer Service Men

The Editor,
Dalhousie Gazette.
Co-Ed Edition.

Dear Madam: Shirreff Hall girls
prefer service men, because service
men are gentlemen, and gentlemen
behave as though you were a lady.
When you walk into a room they
rise, nor do they sit down until you
have chosen the most comfortable
chair in the room. When you are
ready to leave, they help you on
with your coat. If you drop your
handkerchief, your purse, or your
gloves, they rush to pick them up.
They stand aside, holding open the
door, so that you may go through
first.

When you go out with a service
man, you never have to waste an
evening wondering what to do. The
whole evening has been planned
ahead of time for your enjoyment.
You never have to sit through a disagreeable movie twice, because he
hasn’t seen it, but he will gladly ask
to see a show a second time because
you might enjoy it. He gives you
the impression that he takes you out
because he likes you, not merely because “he had to take someone out,
and it mightas well be you.”

They won’t demand payment for
the boredom of taking you out at the
doer. They are usually a little older than university. men and have
learnt the futility of pseudo-sophistication. They may drink, but you
won't have to worry about how you'll
get home. They get plastered after
they’ve taken you home, not before.
They are always grateful to you for
having made their evening pleasant;
they don’t behave as if it had been
one of these occasions at which the
presence of a girl was a necessity,
and that they had struggled manfully thorugh a wearisome evening.
That is why we prefer service men.

Yours sincerely,
A NONNY MOUSE.

1. The “Lounge-Lizard,” who always drops over uninvited, expecting
te spend the evening playing Romeo
and telling you how wonderful he is,
but never, never asks you out on a
real date. Drop him like a plugged
nickle because he is selfish and conceited, take-all and give-nothing
creature, Your life with him would
be one long vacation with his doing
the vactioning and your doing the
paying for it.

2. The “Weak-Sister” type. He
is sometimes found in the first classification also. By “weak-sister,” we
mean that he is unreliable, breaks
dates without proper reasons,, and
has little money of his own,, chiefly
because he is too lazy to work for it.
Sometimes this type has literary
ebility, and fancies himself as an intellectual. He usually has a low

expects the girl to make all the advances! He has almost always been

these words is always pretty and

whom any man would be proud to be
seen, Therefore there’s only ONE
reason why this most charming
creature does not take the girl out.
And that’s because there’s another
woman in his life, usually the demanding hatchet-faced and minded

else. Often this side of a man’s life
is one of which he is, quite natur_ally, ashamed, and the less said, the

I was weary and ill at ease,

And my fingers wandered nervously

Over my quivering knees.

Nor what I was saying then,

But he spoke one line from his fecture notes

And I whispered my last amen.

  
  
   
       
     
 
  

It flooded the golden noon-tide
Like the sound of a devil’s chaunt,
And it lay on my fevered spirit
Like the touch of a gruesome haunt.
It crashed like mad round my ears
And drained my desire to play—
My warm blood froze at the words
he said:
“We'll dissect the frog today.”

Shake Hands
With The Dragon

by CARL GLICK

 

 

When a lanky, home - grown
Yankee becomes gymnasium instructor in New York’s Chinatown,
there are bound to be interesting
consequences. Carl Glick, in recording his experiences as the green but
well-meaning leader who tries to
get to know “the boys”, introduces

 

‘| China to America in “shake Hands

With the Dragon.”

The pathways of other races are
a dependable source of amusement
to the complacent Nordic. Taking
us behind the gay front doors of
Chinatown, Glick offers many entertaining examples of a culture
foreign to ours. As their new gym
instructor he finally got behind the
famous Chinese reticence by presenting a football to the newly-born
son of one of his pupils! Having
become completely acceptable by
this gesture, Glick proceeds to discover innumerable puzzling and
fascinating features of Chinese life.
Before cooking a duck, he found,
they blow it up with a bicycle pump.
They eat seaweed and bird’s nest
soup. At a wedding the parents of
the bride and groom are feted while
the newly-weds take a back seat!
Customs such as these amuse the
rational reader who pronounces
them quaint, and “so typical of the
Chinese.” Yet, as one reads on, the
impression grows that the young
American who has undertaken to
build up the physique of young
China, has found something in
Chinese life below the quaint covering that delights the bored tourist.

From here Glick sets to work recovering the ancient culture of which
the queer pathways he observes in
Chinatown are but bewildering symbols. The reader who has begun the
book for amusement only, is not left
behind. Nowhere does Glick depart
from his casual, almost. flippantly
conversational style. But here and
there, as he records an adventure
with his young Chinese friends, or
an easy talk with the old merchants,
he reveals their artistic sense in
language, the Chinese sense of humor, or the philosophy of parental
reverence to which they strongly
advise. Intrigued by the harmonious life of Chinatown, the Yankee
gym director inquires into the
‘reasons for the very small number
| of criminal offenders among the
Chinese, the total absence of unions,
| Strikes and lockouts, the rarity of
| unhappy marriages, and other problems that continue to worry Amerieans. The customs and behaviour
‘of Chinese Americans became quite
| sensible when the culture and phil, osophical basis behind them is unifolded. With Glick, the reader
Giscovers that Chinatown may have
a lesson to offer America.

Having given America a steer in
the right direction, the enlightened
| gym instructor tackles, only pleasantly and suggestively, the great
problem of race prejudice. (We
have a sneaking suspicion that this
e what he has been getting at all
along, but this time we have become
fast friends with the Chinese, we
‘heartily approve of his effort.)

The whole answer to the race
prejudice problem, as Glick has
shown, is understanding. The “sinster Chinese” becomes a_ truly
charming individual when understood in his own background of
Chinese culture. * Glick gives us
| safe grounds to believe that with
appreciation of cultural background
and a reasonable tolerance, all feeling of racial superiority will be well
abclished by making the acquaintance of the faithful and unobtrusive
laundry-man around the corner —
he may prove a fine friend. (But
before you take this step, a word to
the wise—read the book first!)

A pleasant birth ’mid firmly ’stablished notes,

A sudden cascade into breathless—

But back! Too daring! Follow on a
little.

Work your ends a slow and measured way.

Keep harmony — be patient for the
while ‘

We try to live again our childhood
years

But find them strangely altered —
strangely sad;

A variation mayhap in our minds

That makes us thrash about in wild
regret.

So strong and ending always firm
and quiet.

The theme comes yet again,

The notes speak scorn

Of the staid chords which
slowly at their side;

Striving still to ’scape and every moment wildly darting

Off to higher reaches — tumbling
madly back

In estasy of fear

To join the reassuring hands of their
old companions

Moving in- stately harmony in the
bass.

Thus life moves on throughout it’s
prime, wild flights

Of foolish faney and the staid retreat.

Convention holds

A sure and steady hand mid present
doubt.

Always the appeal to abide by laws
and die of monotony

And always the vigorous flight and
panicky retreat

To smiles—and bows—and masks.
To

Hate the morning.
Curse the night.

Until with beating hearts we gird
ourselves

And say: “Now!

Now to break away

To taste, O at last at last to taste
an ungirt passion!

To leave behind all madd’ning worldly bonds!

To taste the harsher joy of ecstasy

And with the music float above the
clouds!”

Just like the lone—unaccompanied

Notes of the cadence, high on the
piano Stop!

Stop it all! The cadence—

I can’t breathe

For all motion—all life is suspended;

And here for thirteen bars a lifetime
of suffering

Merging into a final acceptance of
destiny.

Four fingers spurning keys, or a violin’s E-string,

All roads lead to the same God—
The humble Chinese, blood-soaked

and praying to his God.

The proud Cossack, the
Australian,

They mumble or shout, cringe or
tower; it is all one

And all here

As the tiny notes send their message

and gently descend,

move

Dream the day.

* Dect Uncle Dugg Gie:

Due to my fellow conspirator Aunt 49" who has ales up so much
_ Space the last few weeks, I have been unable to run my helpful column
5 3 of unbiased advice to stricken lovers. My dears I have received so many
ay te letters that I find it difficult to know where to begin. However, having reWe ceived one extremely sad letter, and having seen the hangdog expression
of this poor creature ever since Christmas, I feel that I should answer
his letter as soon as possible in order to put him out of his misery.
2 es The letter, which comes from Doug Robertson, reads as follows: “I
_ have a crush on a certain freshette, who, because of her popularity does
mi not  deign to recognize me. I feel that I have a very pleasing personality
: "and although many of the boys at R.C.S. called me “Fruit” I realize this
_ was because they didn’t (or did) recognize my true worth. In closing
_ perhaps I had better add that I have taken out another blonde, but as
i this has not cured me I would like your advice on the matter.”
» +My dear Doug, as you know I try to give advice that will benefit
re everyone, therefore I suggest that you keep your date in the early part
ei at March, as you will undoubtedly find many interests in your new
p, Vacation.

Despite the fact that we were up

Halfsmothered from fumes we arrived

in Wolfville, to be greeted with the

ery of “On to Tully” from the girls
who were there to welcome us. Into
Tully we trooped and were immediately hustled to bed, depriving girls

who were as tired as we, of their

rest. However, a few hardy Dal-housians (despite Prom) scorned
yest in favor of a tour of the cam
_ pus—for it was Sadie Hawkins.

At 12 o'clock we were called
for lunch and were escorted to the
dining hall, where pea-soup and
stew awaited us. Then the rush to
the gym started and the Dalhousie
girls were prepared for battle.
Donned in the gold and black and
determined to fight to the last, we
marched on the floor. Half scared

to death by the sea of faces which

we beheld (a thing unheard of at

Dal), we timidly took our positions.

Our timidity soon passed, however,
when our every effort was applauded and the excellent refereeing of

Major Kelly fully restored our fight

top scorer with 7 points, Anita Reid
second with 4, followed up by Vera
Crummey with 2,

most effective against the short
but quicker ones of our girls, and
the score would have been much
higher but for the excellent work
of our guards.

To cheer us after our defeat the
Axettes invited us to “Pete’s” for
ice-cream and cokes, where a little
later we boarded the bus for home.

Despite this defeat, or perhaps on
account of it, we are more than
ever determined to change Dalhousie’s losing tradition and beat the
Acadians in our own gym. This
cannot be done without the support
of everyone, but don’t forget to applaud Acadia, too.

took place last Monday evening. In
the past this affair has continued on
until the week before the exams.
This year we kept right at it and
managed to clear up except for a
few of the finals which will be played off very soon, so watch for the
results. Whom do you think will
win? Goodeve and MacKenzie are
winners of the Women’s Doubles.
The Tournaments are for Dal students. We are pleased with the
number that turned out this year,
but we hope even more will so so
next year,

Professor Mercer, our coach,
is responsible for our continued activity in badminton and helps us to
glide smoothly over our difficulties
by new and better methods. Although the World-at-War duties try
t ocall us away more than is necessary (dancing, etc.) the new-to-Dal
Round Robin system has aroused
some of our “I wonder if I’ll keep

on” players these last few Monday
evenings. This system keeps everyone playing for the greater part of
the time, and the highest Dal scorers take on the highest opponents
for the latter part of the evening in
a tournament. We hope to see this

continued.

Some
weeks ago the Boys (or was it the
Sports Editor?) challenged the

Basketbelles to a wild and woolly
game of cinch basketball, so they
call it. It is easy to see that the
Basketeers have not faced the whiling, dashing, tricky passing of Morrison, MacKeigan and Grummy to
mention a few, nor do we believe
they’ve—but let them find all out
for themselves. We don’t tell all
our secrets of this can’t-be-beat,
except-by-Acadia-once team. By the
way, that Acadia-Dal game was
much better than certain eastern
port papers have announced. What
is a score? Merely the summing up,
but if you’d been there you would
know that the Dal team was good—
their play was just — could it be
better?

WHAT GOOD IS A PUP?

A pup is cute and mischievous, but you cannot tell
just by looking at him what services he will perform
for his master when he grows up.

When the telephone first put in its appearance in
1876, like the pup, few could foresee how serviceable
it would become.

Now the telephone brings folks together millions
of times each day. Communities once far distant are
now next door.

The “Pup” is a real ‘dog’ now.
