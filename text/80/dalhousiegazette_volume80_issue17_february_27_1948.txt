CHILDREN

 

 

By Jack Lusher
News Editor

 

Wednesday, Heb. 25 — For
two hours tonight I steed in a
dark corner in the rear of a
crowded Dahousie gymnasium and
witnessed the Dalhousie Glee and
Dramatic Society’s production of
the Gilbert and Sullivan operetta,
H.M.S. Pinafore.

I left the gym after the performance, passing through the
milling throngs at the exit and
listened to the remarks of the
students who had witnessed the
performance. Theiy expressions of
pleasure and satisfaction mirrored my own thoughts—‘“Great”’,
“Wonderful”, “the best show ever
put on by the Glee Club”, “I’m
going to see it again”, all these
yords and many, many more were
the theme of ‘the conversation
of the student audience afte; the
show.

In the first flush of enthusiasm
ever what was, in my opinion,

‘the finest student performance
ever staged by a Dalhousie Drama
group, I can’t find enough words
to say that Frank Flemming and
his many, willing co-workers have
reached what must be the culmination of all their hopes and
desires in the sometimes thankless task of managing a university
glee and dramatic group.

All the soloists were excellent-Lloyd. Soper and Maynard Tayior fully lived'up to expectations
in their roles -- but it was Eileen
Cantwell who stole the show, with
her sometimes brilliant characterization of Josephine, the Captain’s
daughter. Playing her first leading role in a Dalhousie stage performance, Miss Cantwell received
thunderous applause after each
and every one of her solo parts

-- applause which she truly deserved.
Frank Padmore’s Dalhousie

concert orchestra was excellent.
The long weeks, even month’s, of
practice did much to bring the
orchestra to near,.perfecticn -- the
small imperfections were more
than counterpoised by the enthusiasm of the musicians. And the
vivacity of the very impressive
Mr. Padmore.

 

ARCHERY TOURNAMENTS

 

Practises in archery will be held
in the lower Gym next Tuesday
at 7.00 P.M., next Wednesday at
2.30 P.M., and next Thursday at
5.30 P.M. Draws will be held for

the Tournaments. All turn out.

I. S. $. CHAIRMAN
PRESENTS REPORT

The ISS committee

for funds in conjunction with the

campaign

Canadian Appeal for Children rolled up a total of $800 to date out
of a total objective of $3,000, according tu an announcement this

week by Bernal Sawyer, Dalhousie

ISS chairman.

The Tag Day, which utilised
the services of taggers from Dalheusie and 3 from Kings, brought
in a total of $450.

The Campus King contest to
date is rolling along at t fine pace,
with the Shirreff Hall candidate,
Bernie Creighton, in the letd,
closely pursued by the King’s candidate, Denne Burchell. Bernal’s
report carried this line “Delta
Gamma tnd Alpha Gamma need to
get cracking”’.

A special committee formed by
the Faculty is looking after collections from faculty members.

The Shirreff Htll girls, under
Helen Beveridge, have done t marveltus job in raising money. Bridge
games, and sale of fudge in the
mens’ residence and enthusiastic
backing of their iandidate did
much to swell the coffers of ISS.

cecal ide—ealice
One half of all the children who
have been born in Europe since
the end of the way are now dead.
These babies are the future
citizens of the world. Keep them
alive by giving the food they

These words are not intended for those who have
already decided to cast ballots in the coming council
elections. They are, however, quite definitely intended
for the surprisingly large percentage who will avoid
the polls. Among those who will remain absent there
will be a small percentage not interested in campus
affairs. For such conscientious objectors there will be
soine small excuse for abstinence. But foe those who
take part in extracurricular activities, and who wish to
have anything at all to say about campus administration,
there is liitle excuse for not voting. To such abstainers
we say,, Don’t vote! After all, it is your right to choose.
But to them, also, we wish merely to say, Keep quiet
next year!

Dear Sir:

I have just read the “Campus Roundup” column of February 20 in which your correspondent advoca‘es a revision of the
“D"’ system. He states that glee
elub awards should not be placed

‘would have been this year, if letic
the students had not passed the

té D"s

€

in the same classfication as athwhich require “a
lot more in sweat and effort.”

em 
His arguments are both unjust and unreasonable. Your correspondent is unjust to the many
energetic glee club workers who
put so much “sweat and effort’
in their many achievements. He
complains that. glee club awards
are gained in the “warmth and
cleanliness of gym basements’
as opposed, perhaps, to the cold,
muddy atmosphere cf Studley
field. The writey did not mention
practice in a stuffy, unhealthy
gym basement as opposed to
football drill in the invigorating afternoon air of Studley.

Your correspondent is also
most unreasonable. He cites the
“Blood and Guts” and “nervous
and physical’ requirements of
athletics on the one hand, and
the eglee club atmosphere of
“ecajolery”’ and ‘“‘non-urgency” on
tthe other: football is a nightmare of nervous tension, dramaties a veritable picnic. If the
glee club practised “As You Like
It” and “Rear ‘Ruth’ amidst
mere fun and laughter, their perfcrmances are even more remarkable than was at first realized.

[he writer places a premium
on physical achievement or mishap. Is this the yardstick of the
coveted “D” award? The award
is granted fo; manifesting a high
degree of college spirit of which
athletic display is only. one
means. Your correspondent would
award the highest recognition
of college spirit to those who
succeed in sports alone. The most
enthusiastic and perseveing glee
elub member would have to take

second place to the “spirited”
Studley stalwarts.

The glee club has most certainly done its share to promote
college spirit. Let its most energetic workers be recognized to
the full.

Sincerely,
John P. Martin

approached said that they were
definitely going to vote, and the
only ones in doubt were some of

they felt they did not know enough of Campus obligations to
vote. When asked the question:
“Are you going to vote? Why?”,
the following students replied
thus:

Buddy King, Soph. Commerce:
“Yes, I am going to vote, for I
thnk that student government is

a very important factor as it affects our campus life directly”.

Shirley Weatherby, Senior

that it is my responsibility and

very interested in these affairs’.

Virginia Mosely, Soph. Arts;
“Yes. I think everyone who has

Dal’s Gals

port

By Bev Huntingdon

 

Dal came off triumphant in

the first annual Round Robin
Basketball tournaments between
intercollegiate second teamsewhich
was held here last Friday and
Saturday. Acadia and Mt. A.
were represented but U.N.B. was
unable to come. No official recognition — cup or shield —
accompanies the set of games,
but a more intimate amicability
and intercollegiate show of sportmanship has never been exhibited. The feeling of good sportmanship was prevalent throughout
the games and Acadian and Mt.
A. girls, even when they were
forced to yield to the superiority of the Dal players, and to
realize that they were fighting
a losing battle, nevertheless exerted themselves to the very end.
The spirit and high quality of
the individual and team play of
the Dal girls was exceptionally
outstanding, and the = slated
match between Dal 1 and Dal
2 is much looked forward to,
Special mention is due to each
girl on the Dal team, most outstanding among whom were
Marg Eustace, Gwen Lugar,
Rennie Fisher and Lois Rattee.

Badminton: Gwen Lugar defeated Pat MacKinnon 11-7, 111 in the girl’s singles. This means
that Gwen will probably play
Ladies Singles in intercollegiate
tournaments to be held at U.N.B. in March. Congrats to both
Gwen and Patty for exceptionally
fing playing throughout’ the
tournament.

 

Swimming Meet
At Acadia

The Dal swimming team wiil
journey to Acadia for the Maritime Intercollegiate Swimming
meet next Tuesdty night, and from
preliminary reports the team is
the best that Dalhousie has had
in several years. After an exhibition meet with Acadia last
week with the Axemen which the

valley boys won the Tigers are

confident that with a little rearrangement of the relay teams
they ean take the appleknockers
into camp and give the Foresters
from the University of New
Brunswick areal battle. The Dal
team is well balanced this year
-tnd is composed of eight members. Backstrokers are Kingsley
Churchill and Greg Comeau.
Breast strokers are Don Seaman
and Don Woodward who are also
in the free style relays, and Don
Harrison who is expected te take
the diving competition this year.
Free stplers are Bob Heffler, Bob
Smith and Alan Rubin.

The girls team this year is
sparked by Marg Eustace, free
style artist from Queen Elizabeth
High. With Marg as anchor swimmer, the Dal relay teams this year
should be hard to beat with coswimmers Marg O’Neill, Bryna
Levine and Carol Logan. The
breastrokers and free stylers are
Pat Snuggs, Jean Bowers, May
Mintz and Pat Pigot.

TAKE ACADIA 18-8 TO WIN TITLE

 

The Dalhousie intermediate girl's

basketball team captured the

first intercollegiate invitation intermediate co-ed basketba!] tournament ever held, at Dal Friday and Saturday, to become, unofficially at least, the Maritime champions in their division. Following are
the games contested by the Dal girls, and won by large margins.

DAL 27
Mt. ALLISON 7

The game was off to a fring
start when the Tigresses immediately took the upper hand with
a basket scored by Marg. Eustace
in the first 30 seconds of play.
Mt. A. played far bettey than
they did in the morning against
Acadia, but still did not present
an overly stiff opposition to the
Dal girls in eithey the forward
or guard positions. Gwen Lugar
scored the second basket foy Dal
followed by another basket by
Marg Eustace, while Mt. A.’s only
score was a free shot throw, and
at the end of the first quarter
the score was 6-1 in favor of Dal.

In the second’ period Dal
showed their outstanding team
play, while Rennie Fisher and
Lois Rattee distinguished themselves in their position as guards.
Mt. A. showed much hesitation
in handling and passing the ball,
but it was kept steadily on the
move when in Dal hands. Marg
Eustace again set the ball rolling
by passing it through the Mt. A.
basket followed by a free shot
by Gwen Lugar. Another basket
by Marg Eustace brought the
score up to 13-1 at half time.

In the third quarter Gwen
imgar scored a free shot and two
other baskets for Dal, while Mt.
A. managed to bring their score
up by three points, making a
total score at the end of the third
period Dal 18, Mt. A. 4,

The final period of the game
showed much renewed effort by
both teams. Dal scored on two
free shots and another basket,
while Mt. A. achieved one basket,
bringing victory to Dal by the
score of 22-7,

DAL 18 ACADIA 8

Acadia defeated Mt. A. 40-15
to meet the Dal girls in the final
playoff for the tournament
championship.

The game started with the play
fast but fumbling, as play
switched from end to end as both
teams warmed. up feeling each
other out. Dal scored the first
points of the game when Gwen
Lugar shot a basket that didn’t
touch the rim. The only Acadia
point of the period came after
a foul on Barb Quigley. Just before the end of the quarte; Gwen
Lugar again scored for Dal with
a free shot bringing the score
to 3-1 for Dal

In the second period Gwen cr
gar again came to the fore and
with another of hey seemingly
effortless throws, tossed the ball
through the Acadia basket. Mary
MacDonald shot the first twopoint basket for her team with
four minutes to go. making the
half time score Dal 5 Acadia 3.

In the third period the whistle
had scarcely gone when there
was a double foul under the
Acadia basket. Dal’s shot missed,
but Mary MacDonald sank hers
for Acadia. Marg Eustace’s next
basket was immediately followed
by an Acadia score, but Dal
countered on a free shot. Marg
Eustace then sank two for the
Tigresses. Another Acadia score
brought the third quarte; score
to 12-8 for Dal.

The fouth quarter was played
fast and furiously by both teams
and Dal’s expert inter-team play
and passing up and down the
court showed up. Acadia’s score
remained at 8 for the remainder
of the game, but between sharp
shooting Marg Eustace, a freshette, and Gwen Lugar, Dal’s score
rose to 18. When the whistle
blew Dal had an 18-8 win over
the Valley co-eds and had won
the tournament.

St. F. X. Defeats Dal Grads

In the best basketball game seen this

engaged in a fast,

a long way towards establishing
Maritimes.

The Grads got off to a flying
start, and except for two brief
moments, held a slim lead throughout the first half. Intermission
found the Gold and Black leading,
22-19, and St. F. X. weakened by
the loss of their best guard, Tim
Kyte, through a knee injury.

With the start of the second
half, the Grads opened their advantage to ten points, and appeared as if they were going to
breeze to victory. But then, with
six minutes left and eight points
down, the Xaverians started to

The Tiges rolled in three gouls

_ in the first period to take a com

progressed Dalhousie was content
to play careful two-way hockey.
“Legs” Leslie earned his gooseegg the hard way as he made
several spectacular saves on close
in thrusts by the more dangerous
Santamarian forwards. But Leslie

was getting faultless assistance

from his defence which skated
eff many St. Mary’s rushes and
cleared the puck immediately on
rebounds.

St. Mary’s showed their best
efforts in the scoreless second
period. Don Smith’s goaltending
was tighter than in the first

-eanto, and the Santamarian de
fence had tightened considerably.
They were kept off the scoresheet principallly due to the stout
work of Leslie, who made a
sprawling save on the most dangerous St. Mary’s chance of the
period as Johnny Young came in

largest number since the creation of the right

The giving of a whole case to each of the senior counsél in
Second Yeay instead of having two argue each case; the reduction
to a minimum of fining for court misdemeanor with a consequential
elimination of horseplay; and a scheme calling for more preparation
by the Third Year justices were innovations this year.

Highlights of court sessions
were Colin Henderson Smith's
quip while Sheriff Claude Dingwall was inspecting said Smith's
fingernails on instructions from
Churchill-Smith L.J.C. to ascertain if said Smith was “coming
to equity with clean hands’”.
Said the Social Credit ace: “Were
it not Assize time I would run

Savage). And there was the day
when counsel and public left the
court completely mystified as to
how the ease was decided after
just listening to Their Lordships

Lawyers Take
Active Part In
Student Affairs

Not many Studley students realize exactly how large a number
cf Law students take an
and responsible part in student
organizations; the general impression is that lawyers are elderly people, somewhat,’ detached
from the hum and bustle of student offices at Studley. A brief
review of the offices held by law
students reveals how
this impression is.

On the Council, apart from the
Law representative, Bill Cox,
are law students who
hold two of the five general positions not confined to any ‘faculity. Thése are Harry Rhude,
who is Vice-President, and Dave
Doig, the Member at Large.

In other organizations the tally
is quite as large: in the D.A.A.C.
there is Windy O’Neill, who js
in the first year of Art
Mears, a third year lawyer, heads
the new Publicity Department,
one of the better innovations produced by the Haryey administration. Frank Fleming, the President of the Glee Club is in the

THE LAW SOCIETY

This year has been a very successful one for the Dalhousie.

Law School Society, the activities of which I propose to outline
briefly. The Law Ball, thanks to the hard work of Gordon Hart and
his committee was one of the finest formals held in the last few
years. Our orators Tom Giles and Bill Cox journeyed to Toronto
where they defeated a debating team from Osgoode Hall Law School.
The Moot Court, undey the guidance of a committee consisting of

Alex MacIntosh, Keith Eaton and Bill

Chipman, continued as in

the past to upset the decisions of the House of Lord’s in true judicial fashion, and finally our Mock Parliament promises to uncover

some very fancy legislation.

In interfaculty competitions
the lawyes have given an excellent account of themselves. Bill
Cox, our interfaculty debating
mtnager, deserves a lot of credit
for his handling of the debating
teams; in basketball, rugby and
hockey, with Ken Mathews, Rory
Black and Dave Churchill-Smith”
