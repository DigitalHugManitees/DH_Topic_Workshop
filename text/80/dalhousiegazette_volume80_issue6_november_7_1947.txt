N.S.Premier

Highlighting an address to Dalhousie students this ween, David
Lewis, National Secretary of the CCF, repudiated statéments made
by Angus L. MacDonald, Nova Scotia’s Premier, and declared that,
although he had never met the Premier, he would be quite willing
to appear with him on a public platferm to discuss the issues involved.

In answer to the -Premier’s
statement that- government by
the CCF would ultimately lead to
dictatorship, Lewis implied that

the statement was either delib- —

-erately dishonest, or that if the

_ Premier considered it to be hon
est that it was illogical, For examples to further his argument
Lewis spoke of socialist governmens that have been in existence.

“The CCF has never : paacelabed
itself with Communism, and the
| in Canada,” said the
speaker. But he pointed out that
the Liberal Party seemed quite
willing to accept the support of
the L. P. P. prior to the elections
in 1945. . |

In reply to-.a tatement by the
Premier that once control were
started they would bd unable to
be removed, Mr. Lewis declared
that if controls were good it
would be unwise to remove them
‘merely because an opposing party

‘ placed them in effect. Any new

government would necessarily remove any undesirable controls.
The speaker pointed out that the
Conservative Party of Englend
is ironically listing on its platform that many of the contols
already placed in effect by the
Labor Party would be maintained as necessary to the efficient
economy of the country.

‘THE ELEVENTH HOUR

On the eleventh day of this month we stop for
-a while in the trivial round to consider our dead, who
have fallen in two great wars within a quarter of century of each other. Accordingly the Gazette dedicates
this issue, with respect and gratitude, to those who made
the greatest sacrifice that man can make.

Whether or not we should at this time be concerned
with the efficacy of this mass sacrifice is another matter.
Wars are not prevented by gloomy prophesies or by
profound historical analyses, but by action and preparedness. If the United Nations Organization feels that it
cannot prevent a war, it should be the business of those
countries who wish to maintain the peace to take active
‘steps in that direction.

Instead of referring to the eleventh day, we might
use the phrase “eleventh hour;’’ too often in the past
have countries desiring peace found themselves involved

Survey Reveals Students Favour

Fence On Studley

Overwhelming figures reveal
that Dalhousie students are in
favor of having home kind of a

fence around the Studley field.

been allowed to occur, bonght

thus giving the University an oppoxysunity of building the field
up to some avail. Some of the
Frosh from out of town remarked
that they ‘had been mildly surprised that a fence was not already in presence, as most other
stadiums were enclosed.

A few of our over-intelligent
students came up with the bright
remark that a fence would prevent visitors from looking in at

the games, thus raising the profits for those concerned.

would find a way to get in any
 

way.’ One of our Juniors, who

prefers to remain annonymous,
thought also that a fence would
not add to Dalhousie’s charms,
“and anyway, the children must
have some place to learn how to
play base-ball, and foot-ball, and
the rest. If Dal elosed off their
field to them, it might hinder the
progress of some of our up-andcoming young ‘athletes.”? Ahem!

Marie Dee, remembering many

@ very, very high fence be built,

but also covered bleachers.

A full schedule of inter-faculty
debating swung into action last
week as Law and Arts & Science
teams clashed twice in verbal contest. The boys from Law showed
their prowess, and were awarded
the decisions in both debates.

The first debate of the season
was on Tuesday, when Arts and
Science represented by Bob Kaill
and Alfred Harris, upheld the
resolution that ‘inc vidual liberty

Tre their element,
and won a straight decision from
the judges, Prof, Read and R. G.
Speller. Chairman for the debate
was Whitney Darylmple, President of Sqdales,

Thursday evening at the Munroe Room of the Law School, the
second debate took place. .Arts
and Science, arguing the affirmative of the controversial issue’’
“that Canada should adopt a program of compulsory’ military
training” were represented by
John Trim and Bill Cox, who,
though an ardent Law man, filled
the gap left by the absence of
the second member of the team.
Decision went to the negative,
the Law team of. Earle Urquart
and Al Baccardax. Judges for
this debate were Professors Feeney Cumming and Grant. Chairman for the evening was Ivan
Cormier, Secretary of Sodales.

These debdtes have been of
high calibre, and it is felt that
‘there should be more support

SPORT
REPORT

At the time of writing Acadia sports authorities are pondering
over Dalhousie’s offer concerning a playoff to determine the winner

of the Halifax Intermediate English
made necessary when the Wolfville o

ugby League. The playoff was
fit eked out a 3—2 win over

Kings on their home field last Saturday, putting them in a first
place deadlock with Dalhousie. The offer Dal has made is, to our,
way of thinking, th simplest and most reasonable method of settling
the situation; a sudden death game would be played in either Halifax
or Wolfville, which place to be decided by the flip of a eoin, Acadia
is said to favor a home and home total point series. However, by
the time this appears more will be known, and we won’t ramble on

with useless conjecture.

The big game with St. Mary’s

has been set for Tuesday. Back

at full strength just before the playoffs start, the Santamarians will
be as tough to dispose of as anybody. The Tigers have a high hurdle
in their way. And more than who will emerge from this semi-final
round into the finals will be settled. We'll find out What “26” means.
In perusing the last issue of the Acadia Athenaeum (it seems
to have become a habit with us) we notice one or two (only) references to the Dal trip into this adjacent Zulu land, and they all seem
to agree that ‘college spirit’’ is on the wane at this particular University. This is regrettable. Take it from us, there is nothing so dismal
as S. O. (Spirit Odour). We would, if we could,, pass on our own
suecessful recipe, but we don’t even know the ingredients.

However the people concerned are working overtime to whip up

some of the old time Acadia enthusiasm. The promotional stunt put

on last Satwrday was most interesting .Before the game the various

members of the two teams were announced and described over a

loudspeaker system, and during the game a running commentary on

tthe play was broadcast. It was somewhat akin to the commentary

that accompanied the opener between Dal and St. Mary’s. When

done efficiently it can increase the enjoyment and appreciation of

the game by the average spectator. Unfortunately it has never been
really tackled, and at best takes the form:of nothing more than an
obnoxious noise coming from some far corner of the field.

After their 2—0 defeat at the hands of Acquitania, the Dal
Soccer Tigers are now preparing themselves for a visit by Mt. A.
and a trip down to Acadia — Dal plays a return game with Liverpool on Friday in the basketball wars — Mt. A, has won the N. B. —
P. E. I. rugby championship by taking a home and home series from
U. N. B. Previously they had taken the measure of St, Dunstan’s.

intermediate Hatchetmen eked out a 3—2 win over

‘Kings at Wolfville Saturday to boost themselves into a first place
tie with Dalhousie in the League standing. As a result of the Acadia
triumph, a playoff between Dal and the Hatchetmen has been made

necessary in order to determine a leagtie champion. The game itself
was fast and rugged, and despite often ragged play, the Acadians
staggered off with the victory. Throughout most of the game the
iKing’s’ scrum was superior and their backfield work was more dan
werous. Acadia was quick to capitalize on lapses and it was this

ability that gave them the game. Kings at times were unwise in the

matter of strategy, and mistakes of judgement gummed up many
plays. A feature of the game was the rapidity with which the play
swirled from end to end of the field.

Acadia started out strongly,

Kings outstanding speedster, Fergie Fergusson was injured. He
came back after repairs, but despite an outstanding performance
the shaking up he had received
prevented him from hitting top
stride. After a series of two man
serums Demont scored after fumbling a pass to make the score
3s—0 for Acadia, Shortly ‘afterwards Fergusson made the mest
sensational run of the game,
carrying the ball from deep in
his own end to the Acadia ten
yard line. Kings game within 2
breath of scoring several times,
but Acadia drove the visitors
back after a fumble.

With the wind with them,

 

Kings put on an offensive in the
second half. On the Acadia 30
yard line, the Kingsmen were
awarded a well deserved penalty
kick, and Flewelling booted an
almost impossible field goal. With
the score 3 — 2, Kings put on
tremendous pressure, hemming
their opponents up against their
‘ouch line, but were unable to
score, and gradually they were
driven back. Play ended at centre field.

with a four out of five victory tally in the Dal-Acadia Freshman
track meet at Studley, Nov. 3. This victory comes on the heels of a

3-0 victory by the intermediate Tigers at Raymond field two weeks
ago. The Trigger-toed Tigers totalled thirty-five points against the
Axemen’s aggregate of twenty-two, taking the 440 relay, the mile,
shot-put, and 880 relay. The only win chalked up by the mountainsini tied students was in the broad-jump where “Kangaroo” Crowell

CAMPUS

 

ROUNDUP _

If the ery “Bring out your
dead’’ were ever heard in the
confine of Dalhousie Campus
anytime up until last Saturday,
1 am convinced that eighty pereent of the Canadian footballers
would have gladly thrown themselves upon the cadaver cart. For
a while we gave the Navy the
Square root of a stiff battle, but
they gave us a tenth power Buising in return, But while the flesh
has wilted momentarily, the will
to fight for Dal has not, and renewed energy and drive has been
instilled in the practices.

Tigers Have Troubles

Between ice bags and hot water
bottles the Tigers are revitalizing
themselves an dtheir plays for
the semi-final tilt with St. Mary’s
to decide who will get mangled
by Navy. The Tigers are temporarily on the bottom of the stock
pile. Lee still has a sore shoulder,
Morrisson has a stiff ankle, Mat.
tissonga charley-hore, Woodward
a sOre noggin and most everyone
else stiff bodies,

The Tigers were impressive in
the. Navy game for their fight if
nothing else, Everyone made mistakes. The linemen were at times
baffled by the ‘slick Navy reverses and at other
by the terrific

times bruised
, plunging. The
timing in the backfield was off,

But to those dopesters who
think the Tigers have had it-baloney. The twenty four men are a
Dal team with plenty of fight.
The Irish from the Willow tree
will be facing a new team when
they trot out’ for the semi-final
sudden death game, and they are
going to-have a heck of a hard
time trying to stop that

. is as
fighting mad as ours is

Pete Feron will be back which
is happy news.

The badminton nights at the
gym have been well attended of
late with overflows on

the last
four nights.

There are some good
players here this year and- while
there are no Noel Hamiltons there
are some pretty good prospects
which training could develop,
nicely, In the DGAC we have
spotted one girl in particular
whe looks like a future Maritime
Singles champion.

The basketballers are rounding
into shape for the coming season,
The strongest team to date ta
the Dal grads club which is entered in the City Imtermediate
League. However the intercolleg
iate entry look a little weak,
Height, and experience are apparently lacking as are Dunlop
and Farquhar and Giffen. Dunlop, Giffen and Dave Stoddard
are with the Grad as are most of
the outstanding young basketballers in the City who are over
junior age. For those who haven't
heard, Farq. is down at Springfield studying for a master’s degree in Physical Education. This
leaves the Grads with possibly
the strongest intermediate baslefoall team in the Maritimes,

Dr Kerr Praises Veterans

‘The demands of the second World War brought about an inevit‘able dislocation in the life of all our Universities.
This was as it should be, for the universities had no wish to

enjoy special immunities when the nation was fighting for its very
survival. Besides, fewer - students, than formerly were now applying
for admission, for those who would ordinarily have been registering

were enlisting in the Armed Forces. When hostilities came to an end,
. the government of Canada, recognizing that it could make no better

contribution to the post-way rehabilitation of many of these young

‘men, and women, than to arrange for them to continue their education, undertook to pay their fees a tthe universities of their choice.

THE DALHOUSIE GAZETTE

The first result of this wise
policy was that veterans presented themselves in large numbers at
all our institutions of learning.
There are approximately as many
veterans in Canadian Universities
today as there were civilian students in the Universities of England and Wales in 1939! They
constitute aboyt forty-five percent of the present student body
at Dalhousie.

When it first became clear that
so many veterans would take advantage of the government’s educational offer, certain wiseacres
prophesied that the influx would
have very unfortunate congequenees for all concerned, They were

sure that these ex-service men

would waste their time in College

that they would never settle dow’.

to serious study, they would re-’
gard this university episode as 4
; leasant holiday after the years
of discipline and danger, and that
comparatively few of them would
complete the courses which they
had chosen. It is now quite well
known . that the pessimism of
these dire predictions have been
completely discredited. The vetcrans as a@ whole have given an
excellent account of themselves,
academically and otherwise: This
has certainly been true in Dalhousie, and our experience coinci 2s with ti..: of other univer-’
s'ties in Canada and the. United
States which heve reported on th:
subject.

One of the reflections provoked by the commendable attainments of the veterans in their
elasses is ‘that .some of them
would not have been in the University at all but for the finan
 ejal assistance made available by

the government. This suggests
that we ~ay have many young
;eople in our communities at any
tim ewho could mas -- .

higher educational opportunities
if these were made available to
them. Th right to attend a university has been determined to:
largely by the economic status
of parents, and many young men
of character, ideealism and intelIetual strength have had to terminate their formal education
prematurely because they could

not afford to proceed further...

If it is conceded that money used
for the education of the future

_citizens and leaders of the coun
try is expended creatively for the
common good — and this pro,osition is hardly open to disput— the scholastic standing attained by. the present generation of
veterans may well challenge our
statesmen to see that a sufficient
number of scholarships are made
fvailable to place the advantages
of a university education within

We Killed a Child

After a heavy artillery concentration had pounded our objective,

a small Dutch village, our company advanced along the road now
littered with torn and splintered branches from the trees that bordered the scarred strip eof pavement. My casualty-reduced platoon
advanced cauciously in an extended and dispersed formation through
the fields to the right of the road. Farm houses in the area blazed
furiously. We approached and passed a German transport truck
that lay shattered in a ditch. The driver had fallen ‘from the séat

Dean Wilson Repeats Statement
Reprinted from Dalhousie Gazette, Feb. 8, 1946
“THE UNITED NATIONS Organization offers
mo greater expectation for a lasting peace, under existing
economic and political conditions, than did the League
of Nations in 1918,” said Dr. George E. Wilson, speaking before a gathering in the Dalhousie Engineering
Common Room last night.

At a meeting sponsored by the Maritime Labor
Institute, Dr. Wilson discussed “the fundamental principles of peace”, exhibiting a very pessimistic outlook towards the possibility of a lasting peace in our time. The

_ fundamental principles of peace take into consideration
two main points, human nature and national sovereignty,
said Dr. Wilson. For a lasting peace, for peace at all,
one requirement is a change in human nature. Dr. Wilson

‘stressed the need for this change, but added “human
nature won't change.” He supported this argument by
stating that throughout history, there has been no evidence of a change for the better and ptesent day attitudes
give little reason for hope in the future. Dr. Wilson
told his audience that “man is fundamentally stupid.
People lack imagination.” These elements are absolutely
ruinous to a peace plan, he said, and have existed since
the beginning of time.

TRACES EVOLUTION OF STATE

Dr. Wilson then traced the evolution of national
‘states to the present age where the state is omnipotent.
Sovereignty of the national state dominates all else today
and the sovereign recognizes nothing above itself. He
continued by saying that, with the advent of improved
transportation the state became even more integrated.

_ "They began to feel the need for food and fuel for their
peoples and factories. This caused them to look abroad
for secure sources of supplies and secure markets. They
also wanted a place to invest surplus capital.

Gratitude

The act of liberation was sufficient to compensate the grateful
Dutch people for the too great enthusiasm of the Canadian occupying
army. Merely say that you are a Canadian, and what can be given
in Holland is yours. ‘

Much the most touching manifestation of this gratitude can be
found in the sites given up by Holland for Canadian military cemetaries. Rare as are forest areas and hills, it is in regions like this
that the rows of white crosses and stars of David can be found.

Bergen-op-Zoom, through which passed Montgomery on the
impact of the first crashing drive into Holland: a field by a country
road, surrounded by tall trees. Omman, in Holland’s only real forest
area: a clearing, beautifully terraced by the labour of German pristhe tall white cross with black sword on the upright has at
its back dark evergreens, and before it a stretch of wild, hilly country.
Nijmegan, a name now in Canadian history: the tops of two hills.
The erosses look north over the wooded hills to the prosperous fields
of Holland. At their backs, the now silent fields of Germany.

In a country incredibly flat, the grateful people have found places
to honour their liberators such as could be found almost anywhere
among the endless hills and forests of the Canadian homeland.

And strong was the feeling that overcame me as I read in small
black le*ters the names of many who once played with me on. such

hills and in such forests at home.

WHAT IS WAR? __.

ae being tried and executed by Allied tribunals. Had these
men been on the side of*the Allies they should likely still be fested

_+and would still be receiving decorations froma’ various number of
foreign powers. How’can -there be any linking of ethics with war
when the essential purpose of war is to’ engdye and slaughter as

- many of the opposing side as possible?-- Who are we to judge whether

a person is a criminal because he commanded a group of’-men who

‘murdered’ another group not aceoriing to the interna‘ional code

of war? Who-are we to judge whether our so-called ‘rights are
right or wrong? ee

Possibly I am prejudiced in this view. Perhaps I should not be
writing this; but if I am prejudiced it is possibly because I haye
geen one small phase of war, and I have seen staunch allied soldiers
turned into looters and pillagers of private property, and I shall
never forget the time that I saw a sergeant turn his Sten towards

a German youth who lay slightly wounded. The animal fear of the

youth is unforgettable, and more unforgettable is the savage snarl

_ of the sergeant who fired a full burst into the youth’s face.

developed on an increasing scale and grew in fierceness.
One result of this competition was the growth of fear,
and with it — militarism, the main feature of the period
from 1870 to 1914. The final result of this whole process
of development was war.

: Dr. Wilsen then asked his audience to show him in
what way the general world set-up has changed. Human
nature was the same. Sovereignty was still dominant.
The actions of the U. N. O. were sufficient basis for this
belief, he maintained. Uuder these circumstances there
could be no peace “until sovereign power is curbed and
until some means is found that will change or transform

human nature.”’
