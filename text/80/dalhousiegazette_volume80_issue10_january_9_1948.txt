No Abolition
Of Labor
Progressive

The Labor Progressive Party
in Canada should not be abolished, according to Dalhousie Students approached by Gazette
researcher Patsy Pigot. In ansewer to the question: “What do
you feel about the proposed motjon to outlaw the Communist
Party, the Labor Progressive
Party?”, most of the students replied that if the party were outlawed that Communist supporters
might work underground, and
that the ultimate results would
be more drastic than if they were
allowed ‘to work openly where
their actions would be open to
survey. As Sherman Zwicker said:
“The only way to defeat the
Communist Party is to let them
work in the open where they
are sure to show their faults’.
Bob Kaill brought out that “the
best weapon for combatting any
evil, real or imaginary is to have
a thorough knowledge of its composition and tactics. The solution
to this or any other problem
which may threaten national
security or well-being is exposition and securing of it. If the
Demoncratic principal is valid,
the publie will readily see the
inadvisability of adopting any
system of government which
would be detrimental to its own
welfare. Therefore, any outlawjing action is superfluous as well
as dangerous.”

Donald Cross stated that “The
Communist Party should not be
outlawed! While I abhor the belief of this fanatical group, I

 

hy believe that political freedom
‘ must be maintained,” —

Tour Plans

Announced

As a direct result of the
Christmas Conference of the NFCUS, the University of Toronto
Committee has been empowered
to complete arrangements with
the Canadian railway companies,
for a National Students’ Tour
of Canada during the coming
summer. Since the 1946 conference, the Toronto Committee has
earefully investigated for

tour, this year’s

 

plans
such a and at
meeting presented a factual draft
for the tour.

A train will begin, probably
at Halifax in June, composed of
Tourist sleepers, which will travel
across Canada, picking up students in the towns en route.
Stops will be arranged at points
of interest, since the train will
not be on a regular run, and
cnly students will be permitted
to make the tour.

The train wil] return from
Vancouver by a different route,
and then once again proceed :o
the West Coast, leaving studenis
at their home ports en route.

The complete round trip will
take about one month, and it is
estimated that total cost should
not exceed $225, including meals,
with the possibility of a lower
figure. Details will be published,
and interested students are urged
to contact the NFCUS chairman,
Al Lomas for information.

The Dalhousie University Students Council, after more than
a year of indecision and hesitation, last week joined the N.F.C.U.S.
for the second time. As a result, students of Dalhousie will benefit
greatly, although they may not, at times, fully realize the fact. A

brief perusal of the agenda of the meeting should serve as evidence

that Nifcus is an active group, despite the affiliation with the Com

if negotiations between a widelyknown tobacco company and the

university are suecessfuly coneluded, from the Physical Director’s office.

Th clock and seore board, an
elaborate piece of equipment f
large proportions, is an exact replica of the score board in Stadacona gymnasium in Halifax. It
is operated by remote control
from the scorer’s table on the
sidelines of the basketball coury,
and should do much to aid in the
efficient running of basketball

games at Dalhousie.

LIAISON WITH 1.U.5.

 

Expressions of surprise were
heard from Dalhousians who had
not attended the Students’ Forym shortly before the close of
last term when it was announced
‘that Dal had voted, along with
thirteen other Canadian universities, for affiliation of N. F. C.

UU. S. with the Communist-dom
inated International Union of
Students. At this meeting considerable controversy was held
~Before the decision was reached.
The vote for affiliation was decisive and unquestionable. For
those who are now opposing the
Dalhousie vote this should serve
as a reminder that Students’
Forums are for the airing of
personal opinions. This last forum
was adequately advertised and
was attended by a quorum of
interested students. Hence the
“vote must be considered to be
a legitimate expression of Dalhousie student opinion.

The vote was not made with
haste and without discussion. The
natural fear was that Communists would ultimately dominate
the N.F.C.U.S.; and it was felt
that if Nifcus desired to affiliate
with an international body why
should mot that body be LS.S.,
an organization already established on the campus that has
no apparent red bkemishes?
Geoffrey Payzant, the Dalhousie
tepresentive to the recent L.S8.5.
eonfrence at Toronto, explained
that LS.S. would not fulfill the
same need as I.U.S. An affiliation with 1.U.S., he explained,
would enable Nifcus to participate large scale tours of goodwill
and similar undertakings to dew-icp international understanding.
1.$.8. has no similar programmes.
Mr Payzant further declared
that Canadian affiliation would
be of the same nature as the recent American student affiliation — the Canadian body virtually independent. of the [.U.S,
executive but merely maintaining
a liaison for purposes of organization. The word ‘affiliation’,
in fact, might be better expressed
as ‘liaison’. ,

Possibly the deciding factor in
favor of affiliation was that, along with American universities,

es _ WNifcus might exert a tempering _

influence on the feared spread
of Communism. The opinion of
those who voted for affiliation
might be better expressed in the
following words of Milton: “...a
dram of well doing should be preferred before many times as
much the forcible hindrance of
evil doing.”” Communism is

_ spreading among European un
iversity students, and we, who

take liberty for granted, who

find Communism a_ deplorable
status, shall achieve nothing by
being complacent about its

spread. If we should spnd as much
time endeavouring to spread the

tenets of Christian liberty as
Communists spend in spreading
their doctrines of Power and
Authority we would undoubtedly
be followed by the countless
starving students of Europe and
Asia who are now grasping in
despair for anything that might
ultimately be better than their
present existence. If we shouid
band together as power blocs to

\oppose its spread we should only

add emphasis to the apparent
stature of the deadly ‘alanceof-power policy that has proved
so disastrous and so wrong in the
past. The choice of Dalhousie to
affiliate was a declaration of
action as opposed to inaction. If
we fail to support this affiliation
to the utmost we shall have cause
to fear.

In a past editoral we advised
caution in the approach to this
problem. We still maintain that
Communist leaders are more vigoreus and more unseruplous in
their endeavours to spread the
doctrines of their revolution than
we are in maintaining our political liberties. Since the N.F.C.U.S.
Committee on each campus is

composed of the student leaders
of most of the student organizations there should be no danger of Communist control of our
national organization so long as
each student carefully exercises
his right of vote in Council elections. We have to fear only in
ertia and complacency. The affiliation, we repeat, is a call to
action, for in it we possess our
best and, at the moment, only
weapon against Communism.

DALHOODSIE GAZETTE
Aunt Fanny's
Column

 

Published Weekly for all the
little boys and girls at Dalhousie
School in Halifax.

Dear Boys and Girls,

I do so hope that you all
had a very merry Christmas and
are having a happy new year,
and that those mean old Professors gave you good marks. !
mean, at this time of year you
expect even a professor to feel
jolly and full of good will and
spirits, don’t you? I hope that
you are all keeping your New
Year’s resolutions faithfully; I
am sure that if you promise
faithfully not to chew gum on
Sunday you will keep to it, and
not weaken. Perhaps you should
give it up on Saturday nights,
too. But I must get on with the
column; those awful Editors said
I could only have three hundred
words, which seems so dreadfully
little when you think of all the
things I want to tell you.

I was pleased when they asked
me to write a weekly column for
all you little boys and girls; I
feel that in a place like Dalhousie
you cannot have enough guidance
of the right sort, and that unless
there is a guiding hand somewhere you will all go and do
naughty things, like throwing inkballs in class, and perhaps worse.
Who knows? But I must get down
to my subject, on which the first
column is to be written.

One thing that I don’t like is
the word ‘“column’’; I suppose
that it is necessary but it always
reminds me of those awful political things, or even worse, of
those awful Hollywood things, all
about divorce and nasty things
that you are all too little to
understand. I hate to think of
your young minds being exposed
to such horrors, and, indeed, I
have written strong letters to the
local papers pointing out what
harm the awful Hollywood things
do among young and undeveloped
minds:.like yours. I hope that the
letters will have their desired effect. Of course, the political
things are seen worse; all about
war and hunger and other awful
things. You must never trouble
your little heads about -such
things, and they will never touch
you. If those awful Europeans
want to revolt and riot and so on,
why should we worry? It’s their
own affair, isn’t it?

But I must get down to tha
subject of my column. I’ve only
got three hundred words, haven’t
f. It’s ridiculous, really; those awful editors should know better
than to limit a good, wholesome
influence on the young and helpless minds they write for. I hate
to think of the Dalhousie Gazette
being in such irresponsible hands.
I even ‘hear that one of the
Editors was seen going skating
on Sunday, when he should have
been in Church! Such goings on!
I also heard that another said
that he didn’t think that beer
was bad!!! Horrible! Beer is the
worst well I mustn’t talk
that. The evils of liquor are not
for such young ears And I must
get down to my column. But |
still think that the Editors are...
Editor’s Note: Three hundred
words only, Madam. This column
should appear again next week.

Dictatorship
In College
Student Body

At a recemt student forum,
held in the gymnasium skort) /
before the Christmas exams, 115

 

students voted in favour of Dal
housie, as a member of the N.F.C.U.S., joining the allegedly communistic 1.U.S. In lhght of the
fact that there are over 1700 students at Dalhowsie this year, it
would apear that a very small
group coudd lead the school from
the paths af righteousness —

As an example we quote the
following passage from the stu

‘NEW LONDON COLLEGE

. The students and faculty at
New London Junior College are
witnessing a tight-fisted dictato ship in the student government

failed to use their civil rights...

This laboratory of dictatorship,
#s real as. Hitler's sprang into

“being when only 20 percent of the

students showed up at a student
government meeting on October
27., The officers, seeing the student body’s indifference, voted t,
suspend their constitutiin, took
over the entire direction of student affairs, placing them in the
hands of a small committee, and
even went as far as to order the
closing of the College diningroom for between-meal snacks.

Without interfering, College
authorities are watching the dictatorial trend in student polities,
and also the movements undertaken by many students to restoredemocratic representation.

U.N.B. Students Boycott
Barbers In Fredericton

Barbers For Discrimination
(Exchange Feature)—At the close of last term a special issue
of the Brunswickan, U.N.B.’s student weekly, was published announcing a boycott of four Fredericton barber shops who showed racial
discrimination in refusing to eut the hair of Negro students,
The special issue carried articles, editorials and letters pertaining to the boycott, and the essence of the student opinion was con
tained in an open letter from the president of the Students’

‘eil

which urged all U.N.B. students to support the boycott. A letter of
protest signed by over five hundred students was sent to the Fredericton Chamber of Commerce, and notification of the boycott was
sent to the Fredericton Gleaner, the local daily,

The Students’ Council authorized Bob Rogers, President of the

SCM, in conjunction with the Newman Chub, to co
men and request them to take a stand on racial
the interests of Christian teachings.

ntact local clergydiscrimination in

An immediate result of the exhortions was that the churches pled-~
ged their support. The Fredericton Gleaner when queried why the
story was not published hung up the phone with the cryptic message: “You want to know? — You will want to know,” On another

Alas everything good must
come to an end, especially such
wonderful times as Christmas
vacations. Now that we’re again
reassembled we can start a new
leaf as far as sports are con
cerned. And so we are!
Freshettes are still required
to attend DGAC regularly and

prospective Varsity players, too
must get in their practices.

For those who are “aquaticaliy’”’ inclined swimming tryouts
are to be held at Stad. Teams
which will participate in the incercollegiate meet will be formed.
So, gals, drag out those nifty
bathing suits and trot down to
Stad on Mondays and Tuesdays
at 12° o?clock.

Basketball teams have not as
yet been chosen although tentative lists have gone up. Dalhousie will see this year for the
first time in its history three
girl’s basketball teams in action.
These teams will all entey the
City League and two will take
part in intercollege tournaments
to be held in February. So you
can see we are all looking forward to an exciting season.

{Set For Big Season —

Now that the second term has opened, the Dal Varsity, Junior.
and Juvenile basketball teams are hard at work prepar ing for the
rigorous part of their schedules. The Varsity team is working steadily for the coming games in the Maritime Intercollegiate League,
while the Juniors are practicing for probable participation in the
very impressive in practices, and really have a good chance to go
Dominion Junior championships in April. The Dal Junior Tigers look
a leng way in the Dominion championships. Paced by Jimmie Mahon
and Mason MacDonald, the Juniors rolled to two more easy victories over city clubs in pre-Christmas contests. This is a smooth
working, well-coached team that should be able to take care of all —

Junior competition in the Maritimes, but whether they can go any
further cannot be determined now as no word on the strength of
the Junior teams in the Praries, Central Canada, or British Columbia has yet come through. Augmented, however, by Bernie Creighton and several members of th Varsity squad, this team could very
conceivably go all the way to the finals. Dee Shaw and Scott Morrison, for example, are eligible to play for the Juniors although
they are now members of the Varsity. Both players can satisfy
the age requirements for Junior competition and will be used on
the team if the Juniors can reach an advanced rd@und by themselves.
Dal can be very proud of this team, and if the boys continue to
show the great play they have shown so far they could very conceivably bring a national qiampionship to this University.
Meanwhile, the Varsity is drilling hard for the intercollegiate
games in the near future. With U. N. B., Mt. Allison, Acadia, and
St. F. X. expected to have strong teams, the tigers are in for a
tough season. But under the tutilage of Coach Ken Chisolm, the
squad has been working hard since school reopened, and improvement in their play can be easily noticed. Don Woodward, especially,
has shown well, and should be a starter in many coming games.
Don shows plenty of hustle and fight and is a sharp, graceful performer. His passing is accurate and his rebound work off the backboards is particularly noticeable. The other members of the squad
are also rounding into playing condition and are learning to play
as a sound unit as they become accustomed to each other. Thus
with the team improving and a very attractive schedule lined up,
this should be a big year in basketball at Dal.
The Juvenile team is hampered
by the lack of practice time, but
the boys have plenty of spirit and

the Arena Tuesday Commerce
Skated to a 4-2 win over King’s.
The experience of such Varsity
and former Vaysity players as
LeBlanc, Knickle and Brown proved to much for the Kingsmen,
although they forced the play almost throughout. But the big

difference between the two teams

was the spectacular net-minding
of Bliss Leslie in the Commerce
goal. The Kings forwards kept

kept kicking them out.

Kings out shot the Millionaires

goals for the winners, and
Henderson and Read were the

BOWLING TEAMS
ISSUE CHALLENGE

 

by Alan Rubin

Bowling is a clean team sport
in which unlimited numbers of
players can participate, and it is
& wonder that it has not been
made an interfaculty sport loag
ego. True, the expense to the D.A.A.C. of operating a large interfaculty league would be high
but with the co-operation of the
various faculties this would not
necessarily be the case. Commerce
has developed the system of paying half the cost while the players pay the other half amounting
to twenty-five cents per player,
per game.

The D.A.A.C, was approached
at the first of the term and asked to look into the possibilities of
forming an interfaculty bowling
league but as yet they have takea
no apparent action. The bowling
facilities of Conn & Martell are

open for use every Tuesday and
Wednesday aftenoon and until
such time as an_  interfaculty
~ bowling league is formed, both
the Commerce and Law bowling
teams issue an open challdnge
to any other faculty team that
scores rolled by the early birds.
Those interested should get in
touch with Don Harris-Law or

LAW PINMEN
BOWLED OVER
BY COMMERCE

by Joe Levison

Overcoming apparent reluctance of the D.A.A.C. to orgaize
zn interfaculty bowling league,
the trundlers got off to a good
start here at bal before -the
Christmas exams.

This was mainly due to the
efforts of Rusty Milne, bowling
manager of the Commerce Society. He was able to get two
teams from Commerce, and one
team each from Law and Arts
and Science to enter the proposed league. However, on the day
planned for competition previous
to the vacation the Lawyers and
culture vultures were unable to
meet the money men.

Arts and Science were unable
to bowl before Christmas. but
Law and Commerce clashed twice.
The first game was very close —
Commerce winning by twentythree pins. The smarting lawyers
demanded a return ma@ich and
were trounced by twenty-six pins
this time. It was, however, a
more interesting match than the

total pinfall would indicate. Com- ~

merce took the first string by
enly one pin, but warmed up and
took the second by a landslide.
The final string was close, the
lawyers winning by one pin on
some nice cleanup bowling by
Hugh Dunlop, but Commerce won
en total pins.

Here are the box scores:

Campus Roundnp
By

JOE LEVISON

 

Apparently a little too much
turkey, plum. pudding and greg
was imbibed by the lads of Dalhousie this past vacation. Monday
and the resumption of classes was
marked by the absence of those
players who were supposed tea
make a footprint in the sands of
time by epening the Dalhousie
Interfaculty Hockey League. Our
physical director, John McCormack hopes to balance the booka
by having the games played later
in the schedule.

Those all knowing railbirds expect to see a nice brand of hockey in the league which features
a burlesqueish but at times bloody
panorama for the spectators,
There has been a steady infiltration of competent players into the school from the minor
leagues and suburban centers: If
the type of play is anything like
that exhibited in the Interfac rugger league, those gents with little
or no bounce are advised to report to the Gazette sports department, and at least see the games
frem the safety of the sidelines,

Last years champs were the
med school who took time away
from cadavers and study to down
‘\stiff”’ opposition from thp
engineers. [t ig expected that the
team with the best sapply of innocent freshmen who know the
front of a skate from the back
will emerge the winner this
season. :

Hopes are already boiling over
for the Dal Junior Tigers. After
speaking’ with many of the figures of Halifax basketball this

corner is convinced that if Jun
ior age players on the senior
team can be moved back to the
Juniors when. playoff time rolls
around, then the squad will definitely be a contender for the
Dominion Junior title. There is
some wonderful basketball talent
here in the school and it would
be a nice feather in coach Ken
Chisolm’s cap if he could utilize
it to cop top honours. Chis incidentally played on the only Dominion championship team to
ever come from Halifax. That
was with the Halifax “Y” im
1932.

A much looked forward to event comes up the end of this
in the annual beginners
squash Last

finalists were Art Hartling and

month
tournament. year
Doug Hunt with Doug Hunt winning in a thrill packed series.
The number of players has considerably increased this year and
some of the players who have
been developd in the last few
months are Windy O'Neill, Ned™
Banks, Rosie McMillan, Mac Cochrane, Jack McCormack, Robin
McLean, Peter Mingo, Jack Lush
er and Ina Gilroy.

For those who wish to see the
game played the way it is intended they should make it a point
to see John McCormack and Professor Adshead go to it oecasionally. Professor Adshead is second
ranking member of the Dalhousie
squash team and he is ome of the
faculties best Mathletes.

To those who don’t frequent
the gym very often may we announce the arrival of a new badmintoh doubles team. They are
“Butsie’’ O’Brien and Langille,
mentors of our athletie plant.
Rumour has it that they are willing to meet all challengers.

way. The Features Editor — not

a bad feller when sober — comes
over and says: “We have som»
room for a story, and no story.
Write one, on ‘anything. Make
an announcement.” oyS

We don’t know what an announcement is, but we look at
the news pages to see. Well, the
news pages say that Alec Farqukar is back. Fine and dandy.
They also say that Leon Disputin
is back. Don’t know him. Doesnt

We took the above to the Ea- ~

itor and he said go on. So we
are going on. This is an announcement. A little while agu
a feller came in with a story,
and asked if we wanted it, I:
said something about a man who

went to Africa from Dalhousie,
and worked among the natives
of the upper Congo as a missionary. But the Editor says there
is no story in this because the
students do not want anything
to do with politics; only straight
news about University -vents.

Well, we said, what are we
going to do? But the Editor don’t
say anything. Just make an announcement or two. Straight University events. Well, the we look
at it, most events of interest are
simply not written about, anywhere. But since this is an announcement it doesn’t really matter. The important thing, the Editor says, is to get the story in
the first paragaph. That’s what
we're doing, isn’t it? Another
guy just came in with a story;
apparently some nut jumped out
of a Hall window. This happened
last term, he is told. So he goes
out again. This feller who jumped
from the Hall window must’ve
been really off his rocker. Guess
he saw one of the girls.

CAMPUS FACE - LIFTING

To. many people Dalhousie
the day of Convocation.
There are, however, a few students who learned differently.
We, under the fatherly guidance
of Professor Theakston, sought
to make a living and, incidentally,

to lift the campus’ face in the
process of the former endeavour.
Which was the more nearly achieved is still doubtful. Those
who have surveyed the campus
with a critical eye this fall are
doubtless deeply concerned about
the standard of living of the summer workers. If one reflects the
other these workers would be in
a sorry plight. However, in spite
of the extent to which Dalhousie
suffered we were able to report
a fairly happy summer and that
never since the ice-age has grass

been known to grow so fast.
When it is considered that we
“were faced with the problem ot
disposing of tons of lush fodder
as well as conducting a number
of horticultural experiments in

DALHOUSIE IS NOT RED

HAMMER AND SICKLE FAILS TO

MAKE CAMPUS FLAGPOLE

by P. Juniper MeClod

Shortly after Xmas I was startled — to put tt
mildly — to see frantic reports in the local “press”
announcing that N. S. students had joined communist
federations. Looking into this matter. I got in touch
with the Pres. of the C.C.U.F. This official blandly said
that: (a) he was not in the C.C.U.F. and (b) he did
not go to their meetings, and (c) he thought everybody
should be at least fascist. I left him at (d) and (e)
without hearing what they were, as I was afraid of the
thought police. Finally 1 found McDog of the Council
having a two-by-three at Joe’s; brushing aside three or
four- sweet young things. I sat down beside him, and
ordered a four-by-five, which costs a nickel extra. Damn

   
  

extortion.

“McDoug, I said. * What is all
this Redness that I hear about?
Why have we come to this?”

“What’s all this?” he seemed
equally surprised. ‘‘What on earth
are you talking about, anyway?”

Sadly I shook my head at this
symbol of student gov’t and told
him that Dathousie had joined
a Red federation. I spoke to him
of the widespread annoyance
which would herald such an action. I spoke of the fuss the
“press” was making. I asked him
what was going on anyway.

“Oh, yeah. I remember now,”’
he said. That’s what we sent
Porkington and O’Lumus to Winnipeg for. That’s nothing to do
with the rest of us. Besides, that
was all passed at a forum. Nope,
don’t know nothin’ about that.”

I wandered on and found a
journalist from Radical Bay
speaking to Bernstein Crates, another member of the student
Council Crates apparently did
not want to be quoted, but the
enterprising journalist was slowly pesuading him to make a statement.

“Honest, I don’t know nothing
about it. It was all McDoug and
them fellers who done it. Lemme
up.” Cates was visible perturbed,
possibly because the newshawk
was sitting on his chest twisting
his ear. “‘Ouch,”’ said Crates.

“Well,” said the worthy journalist. “I think you had better say
that ‘while you are not fully cognizant of the exact nature of
our step, I feel that it is a step

in the right direction.’ How’s
that?’’
“Fine,” said Crates. ‘Ouch,

any step is better than no step.

 

Lemme go.”

‘Not wishing to be involved, F
left and slowly wandered up te
Studley, and entered the Apts
Building. Shouldering my way
through a mob of professors,
gloating over their exam results,
I hastened towards the office of
the Gazette. Knocking down the
last three professors I arrived at
the door, and _ slipped inside.
Within was Peeps of the Outer
Circle Society, consuming pretzels and water in large quantities,
When asked why the water, he
replied: “Because, just because,”

Having asked him why all the
reds, etc., and having removed
the pretzels to a safe place, I
sat down to listen.

“No reds here. Merely a little
diversion. The N. F. CG. U. &
wants to make the front pages,
that’s all. All the reds are busy
trying to get into the Liberal
club; more profitable’ Have no
fear, the Outer Circle has fully
enquired into the situation, and
has informed the authorities that
there is no danger.”

After that I dodged out, and
made my way through the lines
of thought police, who were probably waiting for Peeps, and snuk
into the Gym store. People were
busy buying little flags, one red
with a hammer-and-sickle motif,
and the other portraying the Union Jack ____ just to be en the

 Nifus Rey
- Nifus Report
By Ross Hamilton
The following is a preliminary report by Ross Hamilton, President of the Students’ Council and one of the two delegates to the
*N.F.C.1 conference at Winnipeg: .
ms "i ens: opened Monday afternoon, Dec. 29, with an
: address of welcome given by Peyton Lyon, Student Council Pre; sident at the U. of M. There followed greetings sent by the GovernorGeneral, Prime-Minister and other distinguished personages. ——.
; Sauve, President of the Federation then gave the President el at ;
e) He gave a short outline of the hectic history of the F lera ion
| bringing it up to the past successful year. N. A. MacKenzie, now
- President of the U. of B.C. then said when the Federation had its
‘inception “The Federation can never be attained above a —
trom the students.” That statement has shown the pie
ties ‘behind it as only when the students of Canada are so 7 af i ehind their common interests has the union prospered. The N S is

- national union of Canadian university students. Sauve calls “the national syndicate of the Canadian University Se eae ‘
a ‘syndicate it exists to serve the students a eee ace
students to a consciousness of their duties .It canno , a
student syndicalism “thas the essential task to increase the ee .

* of its common points on which a united stand can be taken e 2 Oo
create an atmosphere of eonfidence and friendship in stimula ing

efforts of intelligence and understanding.” During the past —

‘the President has travelled across are Dominion ae ee
L aades i iti iti nion and seeing needs é 
os ee ch os co ee of the D.I.A.U., the national

ate * debate rules, regional conferences, transport to Europe, abolishment

Me of student summer unemployment insurance, student exchanges, and
: varions enquiries of general interest to all students.

At the plenary sessions of the meeting each university was all
- owed two delegates, but only the Student Council President was

| allowed to vote. Observers were also present but sat in the back
Bae ground being permitted to speak when asked although in the work

of the Commissions they could discuss and vote.

be - . There were over sixty-five at the Conference altogether

Be yepresenting in. all twenty-one degree granting institutions. During

7 the first day there was an item on the agenda called ‘Philosophy

| cf NFCUS” which really turned out.to be a discussion about who

the Federation actually represents on the campus. The occasion of
this has been the formation on most campi of local NFCUS Corsmittees which are however all subservient to the Student Counciis

7 “on each campus. After a great deal of trivial discussion 1s was de
. ‘eided that the Council on each eampus was the final authority

- which may delegate the actual working and functioning on the local
campus to a local committee. The NFCUS does of course represent
‘all the studerts but as the Council is the chief student governing

_ organization on it properly ig a-constituent member ef the Federation and not the local NFCUS Committee.

On the agenda as well were other items that were briefly touchae ed upon by the President. The National Film Board is making or
a to make a film dealing with he Canadian Universities. The Fedq eration has had excellent relations with the National Conference of
- Canadian Universities especially perhaps in the past year regarding

the formation of a Dominion Intercollegiate Athletic Union. The

f 2 Conference dealt with this latter subject and more about it will be
ing said. When the Canadian Government sets up a UNESCO OrganizE ation in Canada the NFCUS will be allowed a seat in that body.

There are prospects of yet closer relations between the Student

_ Veterans organization and the NFCUS. Mr. Sauve aided the recently

formed United State National Student Association as it struggled

to be born and we have a close relationship between the two nation’s

student unions. The relationship between the NFCUS and other world

student groups deserves separate mention especially our attitude towards the ISS and the International Union of Students.

reason for the discrimination,” it declares, ‘‘seems to be that barbers
are afraid of losing white customers if they see a colored person in
the. barber’s chair. If there are any grounds to this fear the people
of Fredericton are to blame.”

The barbers are the scapegoats of society, they declared, and
the Brunswick cries “Would that we could show up the Pharisees in
our town as well who piously say, ‘I’m glad that I don’t show racial

discrimination like those poor publicans down there.’ ”

between the two organizations.
Dr. Marcus Long of the ISS spoke
to the Conference after dinner
one evening outlining the work
and purpose and future projects
of the Service. ‘“Provincialism
and educationalism” he said “are
incompatible.” Our great breadth
of knowledge comes from many
parts of the world and to the accumulation which has been built
up and maintained over the centuries is not the possession or result of any one nation. We as
students cannot be narrow in our
views and especially in these days
when we need an international
outlook it behooves us to bend
our efforts towards international
co-operation. The ISS seeks to
foster this breadth of outlook.
As the conditions in many parts
of the world demand that we
spend great efforts and sums in
relief projects the ISS seeks the
co-operation of all students at
this time as it seeks to alleviate
in part the suffering of fellowstudents in stricken lands. Dr.
Long said that he sought (1)—

closer co-operation between the,

NFCUS and the ISS, (2) — membership on the Canadian ISS Executive of the President and Secretary of NFCUS, (3)— a resolution of co-operation and support
for the ISS from the NFCUS
Conference. This spring there is
to be a tremendous effort towards relief and we are asked
to raise about $15,000 for this
campaign. (““‘We” means the national movenignt, not Dalhousie
NFCUS).

At a plenary session Gordon
MacLean of Toronto asked that
the NFCUS set up a commissioa
to prepare a report from the Conference to the ISS. This Commissi0R was set up and the last day
it brought im a report which was
adopted.

In substance this report complied with the wishes of Dr. Long
as stated. The NFCUS will work
with and through ISS in relief
and other international projects.
The question is of course immediately raised “What implications
does this have regarding the -elationship with the IUS?” And
the question was neither discuseed nor asked so it remains to
be seen what the solution will be.

WHAT IS I.S.S.

(Continued from Page 6)
| Relief
A. necessity at present inseparable from the other
functions of I.S.S. or any comparable organization,’ relief is carried on through World Student Relief, a joint
body involving the World’s Student Christian Federation, Pax Romana (the Roman Catholic ternational
student organization), International Student Service, the
World Union of Jewish Students, and the International
Union of Students. Relief costs are contributed to by all
five organizations, and relief is distributed to students
of any race, creed, or political learning, on the principle
of need. There is no so-called “‘merit”’ rating for eligibility for relief. The 1947-48 budget for relief, amounting to two million U.S. dollars, has been allocated as.
follows: Europe, 40% ; China, 40%; South-East Asia,

PH 7
20%.

All relief funds obtained by I.S.S. come from in
terested private parties, institutions such as the Carnegie
Corporation, and local campaigns, in the form of donations and grants. However, W.S.R.: is a temporary expedient. As the need for it subsides it will reduce its
programme accordingly. It is hoped that the time will
soon come when W.S.R. may disband entirely, for then
will I.8.S. be able to expand its programmes of International Education and University Research toward the
unification and strengthening of the University Com
munity in which it believes.

U. N. and UNESCO
I.S.S. is reeognized by the U.N. and UNESCO as
an international educational organization. At the end of
the I.S.S. year 1946-47, UNESCO expressed the intentton of signing a working agreement with I.S.S.

 

WELL DONE U.N. B.

Can you truthfully say, ‘‘I, because I was born to parents whose
complexions happened to be a sort
of pinkish shade (not white), do
not feel superior to anyone whose
exterier is of a different hue.” ?
If you can we commend you, If
you cannot, read on and examine

yourself.
When the staff of the U.N.B.
weekly, the BRUNSWICKAN,

could have been doing a bit of
last-minute ‘cramming’ for their
Christmas exams they were busy
editing and publishing a supplementary issue that served as a
student notification of a boycott
against four Fredericton barbers
who have discriminated against
Negroes. We heartily commend
the these
students; and, lest any Dalhous
admirable action of

ians feel that their action does
mot apply to us, we suggest that
an examination of the evils of
racial discrimination is in oder.
We know of cases of discrimination at Dal and in Halifax but
we can say that these cases, to
cur knowledge, are infrequent.N

The “BRUNSWICKAN editors
were objective in their criticism
realizing that the barbers were
me.ely the ‘goats’ of society. To
the barber a fifty cent piece remains nothing but a fifty-cent
piece. He, however, realizes that
were he to trim the head of a
Negro or a Chinese he should
lose the trade of the few loathsome ‘pink’ people who think
themselves superior. The roots of
this filthy cancer, the most despicable of all the diseases of socalled civilization, are deep, but
net so deep that they cannot be
removed. The action of the
Brunswickers is a thoughtful step
in the right direction.

We condemn the attitude of the
editors or owners of the GLEANER, the Fredericton daily, who
refused even to mention the fact
that a boycott was declared by
U.N.B. students. In a city the
size of Fredericton the actions
of over 1700 students certainly
cannot be said to be not newsworthy. The GLEANER’s attitude
Is, perhaps, a manifestation of
the very evil that the students
have decided to fight. How can
the word ‘democracy’ have any

the Press hides
if the Gleaner
chooses to this action
what other important matters
might they choose te hide?

At this point we feel that it
is opportune to point out that the
main cause of the trouble now
eceurring in the Holly Land ie
that of racial discrimination. How
would you feel if you, by accident
of birth, were born a person without a homeland, whose ancestors
had been persecuted for centuries, whose relatives and friends
had been slaughtered by the
millions by the fiendish machines
and who discovered

laugh at Hitler’s theory of the
master-race and yet we permit
it to be believed by members ef
