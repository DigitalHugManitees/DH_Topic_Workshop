CONNOLLY SHIELD
PLAYS EXCELLENT

 

By Bud Kingsbury

The teams entered in the Dalhousie King’s Connolly Shield
Competition presented their plays
last Wednesday and Thursday.
Professor C. L. Bennet, adjudicating for the five dramas, said
that the individual actors presented their parts very well and the
task of judging the best male and
female players will be very difficult. This year a prize will be awarded to the two best individual
actors as well as to the best team.

The Dalhousie Newman Club
presented’ “Getting Pinned” and
improved very much on the original. Janice Thomas did an excellent job of directing as did the
actors in carrying out theiy parts.
Professor Bennet praised the
acting of John LeBlanc, Carmel
White, Bob McLellan, Vasco Morais, Bernice Parsons and Valerie
Cato. He said Joyce Madden had
played the part of the brat to
perfection, and that it couldn’t

have been improved upon.

FRIDAY, MARCH 12, 1948

D-DAY

Marking the first effort of is kind in the Domin, 1 of Canada, Dalhousie students operated radio stat
 
    

   
   
     

ir who had previously in
Bulletin Board. Mr. MacDonald, himself an ex-DalhousBee ian, gave the idea his wholehearted support, as did every
~ ane in ember of the CJCH staff.
During the day’s operations the staff of CJCH
stood by to give aid to the student announcers, and it
me cant is history that both student and CJCH announcers enane ev () joyed themselves thoroughly. Even when the students
pulled “fluffs” or “Booted” their words, the CJCH staff
Les were more than tolerant. Those Dal boys involved in the
ae proceedings will remember for some time the helpfulmess of such men as Don Loughnane, “Skix” Mac Kimmey, Cy Lynch, Harry Norris, Bill Hawes, Clive Schaf_ ér, Don Delaney, Sid Pilkington, and, last but not least
, “ ‘anny Gallivan.

' Special mention should be made of Clyde Douglas

the Station’s Programme Director, and the Director of

- the CJCH Playhouse. In co-operation with Ken Phelps

of Dai, Mr. Douglas gathered an almost totally inexper
fenced group of actors, and worked with them until he

fi was able to produce two plays which were up to the usual
Yi, _ high standard of Playhouse productions. ay
mh Thanks are also due to the Halifax Musicians’ Unte tion. Since Dalhousie Day was of a non-commercial nat

    

 

ure, they waived the prime ruling of the union to allow

Dalhousie students musicians to go on the air, without
-aunion stand-ins.
| To one and ali who made Dalhousie Day possible,
_ we say “Thank you!”

—$————— et

Dear Sir,

Regarding your report of
the Sodales meeting as held on
March 4th., may I correct the
impression given that the election was declared invalid due to
the membership of the meeting.
As all members of the student
body are members of Sodales,
all are entitled to attend general
meetings of the Society. Nor was
there any error in the attendance
of students who had not been
present for the inter-faculty debate held prior to the general
meeting; it was quite in order
tor them to arrive only for the
meeting.

The real cause for discontinu
ing the meeting was the fact

that the necessary quorum of 25
members, as required by the Constitution of Sodales was not present, and it was on this basis that
a new meeting was called.

W.B. Dalrymple,
President, Sodales

Dear Lew:

On behalf of the Munro
Day Committee I would like to
extend my sincere thanks to all
those students and other interested people who gave so willingly of their services in preparing
the Munro Day Programme for
1948.

I would like to thank particularly the Freshman working-party who worked hard and willingly placing the thousand or so
chairs in the gym at supper hour
and removing same after the
show. As a small token of appreciation I would like you to publish
their names in the Gazette -- they
are:

Richard Bierhoff, John Bowman,
David Hess, Doug Jaggs, Edward
Mulock, George Orman “Dipe’’
Marshall, John Demers, Donald
Dickson, David Genge, Don Johnson, Cliff Harris.

Lastly I would like to extend
my thanks to the other members
of the Munro Day Committee,
namely Marie Milton, Joyce Cameron, Bob MacDougall, Bob Ward,
and Bernie Creighton; and also
to Mr. O’Brien. Any success of
the Programme was in no small
Way due to the unselfish efforts
of these people.

Yours sincerely,
Jack Boudreau

Students Make History

 

For the first time in the history of Dalhousie University the

student body took to the air-waves via station C.J.C.H., for thirteen
whole hours on Monday, March 8th., the day before Munro Day.

It has been appropriately called Dalhousie D— Day because it

was the first venture of this sort ever taken on by any college students in Halifax. It was an undertaking with a great amount of responsibility, but regardless of all the jnexperience the occasion was
considered an outstanding success, according to an announcement made

by those in charge.

Under the artful direction and
work of Art Mears, publicity director for the student body, and
through the close cooperation of
the station staff including Don
Loughnane, chief announcer at
CJCH; Fred Bonnyman, CJCH
opprator; Chyde Schaefer, statjon announcer; Reg. MacWilliams,
chief engineer; and Finlay MacDonald, station Manager, D—
Day opened and closed with words
of praise from its numerons listeners,

Approximately thirty students
took part in the arrangements
or in carrying out of the complicated program. Among them
were, Lester Page, assisting Art
Mears as station manager, Philip
Walker, chief announcer; Ian McDermaid, John Trim, Joe Levison,
Al Lomas, Bruce Lockwood, Joyce
Whitter and Moyra Seeger, announcers; Phyllis Scott, librarian:
David Hess, Don Rogers, Ian
Palmeter, seript writers.

The students took over at 7:09
am. to begin D—Day with a
varity show, at 10.00 am. there
was an interview of “Kampus
Karacters”, and a reading of a
talk whiten by John Fisher, noted CBC commentator, on. Dalhousie was held at 10.45 am. The
scheduje continued with a discussion on college fashions conducted by Mrs. Abbie Lane,
Moyra Seeger, and Joyce Whitter.
Don Warner, populay Dal orchestra leader, MC’d a _ disc-jockie
program next and a satire on the
regular CJCH feature ““Mooshead

Dalhousie has won the protest lodged on Saturday’s game against St. F.X. Now the Tigers play a home and home series (the
early season tie at Antigonish was thrown out too) with St. F.X.
and then meet Acadia for a replay of the game in Halifax which
Dal won 4-3. Even if we split the Xaverians, we are still in a good
position, and if we win both the sun will be shining! As we write
this, the team is stowing its gear for the journey to Antigonish, and
by the time this appears the result of the game will be long known,
Possibly, with the winning of the protest, the Dalhousie fortunes will
turn, and the Tigers will get at least an even share of the breaks.

. Of course the worst break came in Willy Robertson’s leg. Willy
constituted a great deal of the life of the team, and he was its most
feared scoring weapon. Willy Robertson gives all he’s got, up and
down the ice, and his loss has cast a deep cloud over the chances of

_ the team.

Never did we see a sorrier outfit than the Halifax Forum. On
Thursday, when Dal defeated Tech., Murray Malloy scored a goal
which passed right through the back of the net. Big argument, but
the Tech goal judge declared no goal (possibly Paul Lee’s performence at the other end had inspired him). Before the game with St.
F.X. Saturday, three pucks were shot through the leaky twines while
the team was warming up Leslie. Jimmy Gray and ref. Charlie Copus
went to see the Forum manager. “Aw naw - we can’t put in the nets
unless wegot Hizzoner the Mayor’s permission.” was the answer they
got. You know what happened. Then, on Monday, the Tigers went
out to the Forum for a practice. When they got there anothe; team
had the ice. And the Forum had phoned Joe Levison the night before to say we could have the rink at that time. They should be billed
with the taxi fare it cost to get out there. Even my old friend Cipin
of Appleknocker fame has been kicking them in the pants. Why, you
could skate and play hockey on their crust.

Juniors Walk Over Q.E.H.
Win City Championship

The Dal Tigers won the Halifax Junior Basketball crown last
night when the Junior team defeated the Queen Elizabeth High
School Juniors, 44 to 16, in the Dal gym. The Tigers led all the way
except for brief moments in the opening minutes of play. But the
Winners soon steadied and assumed control of the game. It was just
& case of too much savvy, and the Tigers won going away. The victory
was Dal’s second in the best of three series for the city title, and
the Tigers now move into the Provincial playoffs, meeting the Acadia
Juniors this week as they start their quest for a National champion
ship.

 

 

 

Dal’s Gals
In
Sp

ort

By Bev Huntingdon

 

At one of the best basketball
games of the year Dal defeated
Mt. A. 1 in a 17-16 victory at an
exhibition game at tie Dal gym
on Saturday. The significance of
the -game lies in the fact that

the Mt. A. team holds the Maritime championship for the current year. Dal’s gals were put
out of the running for the title
when they were defeated by a
total point set of matches with
Acpdia. The game everyone is
looking forward to is the match
between Dal 1 and the undefeated Dal 2 team. In my opinion
the chances of victory are very
even for both teams,despite unappreciated crancks from various
sources.

Dal’s gals made a wonderful
showing at Acadia in the swimming meet, breaking a number
of records, and in géneral for
being such good sports - I think
that Joe Levison found that instead of counting the chickens before they were hatched he had
mis-counted the eggs.

The winners of the doubles
tournaments in badminton are
Jean Bowers and Patty MacKinnon who captured the game from
Gwen Lugar and Marg O’Neill
(15-4, 15-9).

‘SHEET

BOTH TEAMS PLAY POND HOCKEY
ICE BUMPY GOUGED AND STICKY

 

Dalhousie tigers moved back into the Nova Scotia intercollegiate hockey picture at the Arena yesterday when they downed a hapless St. Mary’s squad 3-2 in a regularly scheduled contest.

With two gams to be replayed
and a decision pending on a protest over the controversial Dalhou
sie — St Francis Xavier contest
last week, the Tigers, who have
been improving with every game
appear to have a good chance to
move up with the league-leading
St. F.X. and Acadia squads. The
winner of the Nova Scotia Intercollegata Hockey League is slated to meet the P.E.I. winner Saturday in Charlottetown, and it
may be that a round-robin series
will be run off at Acadia and St.
Francis Xavier to decide the
league winner. John MacCormick,
Dalhousie physical director, said
yesterday that such a plan is being considered by the league executive.

Jonny Young led the Irish,
scoring both goals. The Irish open.
ed the scoring in the first period
as Young rapped in a goal at
the ten minute mark on a screener shot. Rosie MacMillan came
back for the Tigers three minutes

‘later to knot the score, picking

up Ted LeBlanc’s pass and rifling
the puck past Don Smith, St.
Mary’s goal-keeper.

Young put St. Mary’’s out
front again at the two minute
mark in the second frame as he
got a break-away from his own
blue line, outskated the Dalhousie
defence, drew Bliss Leslie out of
his goal and flipped the puck into

 

TIGERS TROUNCE TECH
IN WIDE OPEN GAME

Goals were plentiful at the Forum Thursday as the Dalhousie

The game started slowly, but
picked up in tempo as the Tigers
Started roll. Leading at halftime,
22 to 6, Dal continued to pour
it on in the second half, leaving
the high school squad far behind
Paced by Jimmie Mahon, the
Gold and Black were easily the
superior team, their passing,
shooting, and backboard play being much better than the losers!
In victory, however, the Tigers
were far from their top form, and
their play at times was often
quite ragged.

Mahon was the leading scorer

of the contest with 14 points, with
Mason MacDonald runner-up with
8 markers. Syl Gossac and Andy
MacKay also played good ball for
the victors. Albert Smith was
the top scorer foy the Lizzies with
8 points, but Earl Smith was the
pick of the losers, playing a good
steady floor game.

The line-ups: Dal — Mahon 14,
MacDonald 8, Gossac 7, Beckett
4, Palnick 2, Rosenfeld 2, MacKay
2, Tanner 1, Marshall.

Q.E.H.S. — A. Smith 8, Drysdale 4, E. Smith 2, Fancy 2,

In the last minute of a .-thriil

packed series Medicine went a
head to win the Interfaculty
Basketball Crow: by one point.,
on Munroe Day. Law went into
the final game with a seven point
lead over the Meds, collected in
the first game of the total point
series when they defeated the
latter by a 34-27 score. But Medicine led almost all the way in the
second game, finally catching up
on the round with one minute to
go. Pete Hannington picked up
Pave Churchill-Smith’s rebound
and let go a shot a split second
after the bell sounded to end the
game. It was ironic that Hanningten’s shot sank into the basket
without hesitation. A second
Sooner and it would have won the

series. A large crowd was kept
on edge throughout by the closeness and thé drama of the play.
Arts & Science had been eliminated by Law vy only one point
in the semi-finals, and the playoff series was probably the
closest in the history of interfaculty basketball at Dalhousie.

; | DAL GIVES VAUNTED X-MEN RUN FOR IT

Lie r -PROPPER, WHALEN, WOODWARD SHINE

St. a ake s Be i basketball team made that University’s
atitaston of Dalhousie a complete success last Saturday night when
, f-the cage squad downed the Dal Varsity, 52-42, in the Dal gym.
The visitors jumped off to an early lead and never relinquished it
although the Tigers closed the gap to two points midway through the
second half. Led by the brillinat Hank Propper and Lorne Whalen,
the Xaverians used their fast break to good advantage and bottled
up the Dal attack with a tight man-to-man defense when the Tigers

started to move.

The first half was slow and
_ was saved from being a complete
bore by the great performance
of Propper. This operator not
only does a bulk of St. F. X.’s
_ scoring, but sets up numerable
other scores with his fine passing. It wasn’t until Propper left
the game late in the first half
that the Gold and Black could
do any consistent scoring in the
first period. The winners held a
24-to-10 advantage at the end of
the first twenty minutes of play.
_ At the start of the second half,
the Tigers looked like a much
different team, however, as they
started to drive and hit consist_ «ently. Paced by the outstanding
play of Charlie Connolly and Don
Woodward, the losers closed the
margin to two points. But with
the Xaverians leading 28 to 26,
Propper again sparked a new
attack for the winners, and they
hit for ten straight points to
settle the outcome. In the final
five minutes the two teams gen
erally matched che other point
for point. Dal’s star performer
in this game, Charlie Connolly,
had to retire late in the second
half when he sustained a charley
horse in his right leg.

Three men, Propper and
Whalen of St. F. X. and Woodward of the Tigers, tied for top
scoring honors with 15 points
each. Woodward, excelling on
passing and dribbling, was a
vital cog in the losers’ attack.
Connolly was all over the floor
and proved a tower of strength
for the Tigers on both offense
and defense. In addition to Propper, Whalen and Kyte were particularly noticable for the Anigonish squad.

The Line-ups: St. F. X.— Propper 15, Whalen 15, Kyte 8, McLean 5, Hanusiak 3, Mifflin 2,
McNeill 2, O’Sullivan 2, Bond.

good use of their small floor,
and effectively squelched Dal’s

DAL PROTESTS GAME ON ON DISPUTED GOAL
St. F. X. USED GOALIE AS GOAL JUDGE

St. Francis Xavier, in a bitterly fought battle at the Forum
at the Halifax Forum Saturday, eked out a 7-5 win over the Dalhousie Tigers to tighten their hold on first place in the Intercolleg
iate Hockey League standings.

The score at the end of the
first period was 2-1. for Dalhousie, with Reardon and Malloy
the marksmen for the Tigers and
big Dunc MacIntyre for St. F.
X. MacIntyre’s goal was a screened shot from the wing which
bounced off an arm and Leslie
had no chance. Shorty MacDougreat style for the Xavierians.

The “second period was scoreless, and Leslie and MacDougall
were rising to the harder shots
to handle, but MaelIntyre and
Cleary were ever dangerous on

the St. F. X, attack.
Robertson’s disputed marker
was the first action in a scoring
way in the third period. Willy
got the puck in front of the net
and fired from point blank range.
The puck bounced off the boards
behind the net and the light went
on. Then it went off. It appeared
that Marty MacIntyre, the St. F.
X. regular goal-keeper was the
goal-judge, which violated the
C.A.H.A. rule that a membey of
a team shall not be permitted to
goal-judge. After a tremendous
rhubarb, rferee “Rock” Sullivan
faced the puck in the corner amid a chorus of boos, and the
game was continued. A few minutes later Churchill-Smith scored
the neatest goal of the game as
he was left uncovered in front
of the net after Willy Robertson
had made a brilliant play to set
him up. Then came a penalty to
MacMillan for tripping. It was
an odd penalty because Rosie
kept possession of the puck during the whole play. Nevertheless,
he went off, the Dalhousie defence fell to pieces, and St. F.
X. pumped in three goals to take
the lead 4-3 with about four minutes left to play. The stunned
Tigers recovered, -and !/ after
several near misses ‘Windy’
passed in the tieing goal, The
large crowd came close to going
wild, but they composed themselves for the overtime which was
1ow inevitable. a
The tired Tigers fell apart in
the overtime. The first goal came
as Chaisson fooled O’Neill as
Windy was trying to stickhangje

out of his own zone. Chaisson
passed to Cleary, who had no one
to beat but Leslie. The Tigers
went wide open trying to get
that one back and the Xavierians
scored twice more on breakaways.
Robertson got one back, but th:
game was gone,

Superior conditioning told in
the latter stages of the game,
but the Dal team, and the hundreds of supporters who cheered
them on feel that the final score
should have been 5-4 for Dal
on Robertson’s goal which would
have made the overtime unneccessary. Dune MacIntyre and Shorty
MacDougall were the outstanding
men on the ice, but Leslie
matched the respected MacDougall shot for shot until the third
period decay which affected the

‘by Sherburne McCurdy

The recent action of the Board
of Governors of McGill University
in forbidding senior members of
the faculty to take an active part
in politics is the cause of considerable concern. Why is it that
the governing body of the nation
should be deprived of the services of men who have assumed
positions of leadership in nearly
all other walks of life? Is the
business of government so simple that the services of learned
men arg no ‘longer required? A
glance at our political record,
laudable as it may be, surely
shows some sign of the need for
improvement. I am not totally

aware of the reasons behind the

MeGill Board of Governor’s decision, but be those reasons political or otherwise I feel sure that
if the resolution is put into effect
we the nation are to be the los
 

   
   
  
  
    
  
  
   

ers. In the past, members of University faculties have made commendable contributions to our
political development. In a nation such as ours where two totally different peoples live side by
side, it is essential that our domestic policies be shaped by men
whose outlook rises above that
of narrow provincialism. A little
more sagacity and a lot more
knowledge would have avoided
much of the dissension that exists between English and FrenchCanadians today. The seeds of
discord were thoroughly sown by
ignorant nationalists on either
side. It seems to me that qa more
active participation by University Professors would have alleviated much of the stupidity which
burdens our domestic policics.
As we look across the ocean
we see activities similar to those

in politics. The British government has just passed a Bill abolishing the University representation in the Commons. Looking
at this question theoretically and
from a democratic point of view
this action can be perfectly justified. On the other hand it may
be said that the Trades Union
Congress exerts a disproportionate amount of influence on the
domestic policy of the British
Government.

It is my belief that as the
business of government becomes
more complex, and such is certainly the trend, it is highly regrettable that a movement is afoot to discourage rather that
foster professorial participation
in national and domestic politics.
Let us hope that public reaction
to such a movement is sufficient
to halt, and indeed, to reverse it.

 

A LETTER TO THE STUDENTS

To Dalhousie Students:

This is. an apology, made
not’ by the Students Council, not,
by the Awards Committee, but by
myself, for a great oversight made
the evening of Munro Day. The
apology is directed to the entire
Gazette staff, particularly the
editor and Art Moreira, who are

sight, and who have suffered
many slighting remarks during
the past week, beeause of a foolish mistake on my own part, and
the viciousness of false rumors
on the part of some impulsive
members of our university.

The matter concerns the award.
in g,or apparent non-awarding of
Gazette Gold and Silvey ‘‘D’s’
Four names had originally been
recommended. by the Gazette
which were approved by the Awards Committee. However, after
a motion passed hy the Student’s
Council on March 4/48, to the
effect that those possessing Gold
“D’s” within a society could not
be awarded additional Silver
“D’s” within that society, two
of the Gazette names were automatically dropped from the list
(being already in possession of

No before
Munro Day to solve the problem,

and I intended to explain to the
audience following the presentation of the other awards, the
facts+ that two members of the
Gazette Lew Miller, the
tditor, and Art Moreia, would
receive their awards. in the near
future. However, due to the fact
that my memory has a habit of
vanishing very quickly, as I have
discovered when writing exams,
I neglected to mention our worthy
student publication, after which
I received no end of criticism,
not from those in question, but
from students all over the
campus.

Therefore, I humbly apologize
to Mr. Miller and to Mr. Moreia,
who will receive Silver “D’s’’, as
a result of a recent Awards Committee decision.

Since I’ve gone this far, I
might as well add a little more
steam, and get rid of a few
thoughts and ideas that have developed over my four years at
Dalhousie and which concern the
general attitude of Dalhousians
towards the Student’s Council.

> COMPETITION 
Once again the student body
had the opportunity of seeing a
number of one-act plays at the
Dal. Gym. This year there were
five of them, three of which were
staged last Wednesday eveing,
the other two the following night.

I believe it was Captain Connolly’s:

intention that these competitions
should foster interest in dramatics
and give students an opportunity
to appear on the stage. It has also
served as good training for those
who are interested in the dramatics department of the Glee
Club, The grounds on which these
plays are judged:-(1) all-round
presentation (2) staging, (3) individual acting, (4) make-up, (5)
success of the presentation relative to the merits of the play
presented.

The first one on Wednesday
night was Arts and Science’s
“Send Her Victorious”, by Philip
Johnson, obviously no relation to
Ben, Only a fair one-act play, the
plot centered around the mental
gymnastics of Mrs. Tracy a young
wife who alternated between a
belief in reincarnation and
“Happiness through Nudity”.
Lorna Inness took the part of
Mrs. Tracy, and although the part
could have been played up a little
more, it was very well done. She
had that stage assurance which
adds so much to the effectiveness
of a play. Ken Phelps as Mr.
Tracy played his part with usual
enthusiasm and succeed in carrying the play through. John Trim
as Mr. Cardew did his part very
well, although he was a bit stiff at
times. Myra Seegar was at once
one of the best actors and the
poorest speaker of the play. Her
actions suited the part, but her
voice was almost inaudible at
times. The part of Sinnett, a very
short one, was singularly well
given by Murray MaclInnes.
fine job of presenting a rather
difficult play. They chose “The
Monkey’s Paw’” and succeedpd
in holding their audience right to
the last. Don Clark, as Mr. White,
played what I thought was the
most difficult male role of the
group, and did it very well indeed.
He played a role that was entirely
cut of character with his usual
self, and it is in that situation
that acting ability counts most.
Danford Kelly as Herbert gave
a good interpretation of his part,
it being somewhat easier than Mr.
Clark’s part, as Herbert was a
young man of about Mr. Kelly’s
cwn fears. Caroline Marshall, as
Mrs. White, did well as a partner
for Mr. Clark, and between them
the tragic tension was sustained
throughout. Bob Muggah took the
part of Sergeant Major Morris
very well, although at first he
gave the impression of being a
comic character. Chief defect in
George Burchill’s portrayal as Mr.
Sampson was the horrible makeup. As Professor Bennet said in
his adjudication, there was no
doubt Mr. Sampson was the bearer of bad news as soon as he came
cn the stage. Sound effects were
somewhat spotty in the performance. The wind blew a bit too
steadily in the first scene, and
‘at the last moment the knocking
at the door was too insistent.
However, the play as a whole was
successful and a credit to the
King’s students who presented it.

The Newman Club presented
an almost incredibly bad play in
a very credible fashion. “Getting
Pinned” is no credit to Grace
Barney, but its presentation de
did her part quite well. Joyce
Madden gave the best performance of the group as Janice’s
young sister Dinah. Without her
lively chatter the play would have

been hopeless. Carmel White took
the role of Mrs. Stirling, and al
though she wasn’t too sure of?

her lines she acted the part very
well. Valerie Cato enlivened the
maid’s role with a few giggles and
thus added to the fun. Good supporting roles were given by Vasco
Morais as Harold Ford, Bob MacLellan as David Lansing, John
Leblanc as Hayward Darrarce,
and Joan Casey as Verna Garson,

On Thursday (vening the girls
took over. Delta. Gamma girls
were there first with “Petticoats
Preferred’. Beverly Huntington
appeared ‘as Maddelena, and although her tone lacked some of
the cattiness that should have
been there, her girlish giggles over
the plot to trap her mother-inlaw were very authentic. Holly
Flemming gave the best performance of the play as Teresa. In her
appearance as a policeman at the
end, she lacked masculinity but
otherwise she carried her part
very capably. Quite good supporting roles were turned in by Phyllis
Aitken as Giovanna, Ann De
Carteret as Francesca, Janet Cameron as Angela, and Caroline
Logan as Nita. Generally the play
went smoothly, but lacked enough
punch.

Pi Phi’s ‘‘White Iris” was one
of the best of the competition.
Four girls catiried fit off very
capably and succeeded in maintaining the tense atmosphere till
the final curtain. Peggy Rundle
as Jessamy carried the most
difficult part with assurance and
is a strong contender for the individual actress’s award. Margaret Goode appeared on the stage
once again and showed that her
experience on the Dal. Stage is
improving her acting with each
successive role. There were places
when her tone lacked a bit of
the necessary bitterness. Janet
Sinclair as. Doreas did a great
deal to hold the audience from
breaking during some of the more
dramatic moments of the play.
Beryl Beatteay was beautifully
fluttery as Lucy Clair and served
as an antidote to the tragic
element that hung over the whole
performance.

Professor Bennet appeared as
the adjudicator and in addition to
his adjudication he discussed the
prime purpose of the competition.
His adjudication was sympathetic
and his criticism very constructive. In the light of the good
work done by the five competing
societies his decision has been
rendered very difficult. I am
quite sure, however, that the com.
petitors will accept his decision as
having been fairly given after

serious consideration of all five
entries.

would provide a medium for work of a literary
or artistic nature which the Gazette should not
properly handle. This suggestion is one which is
not unnatural, since other Universities have made

a success of similar periodicals.

In a University, of all places, there should be
an output of material far above normal newspaper
standards which should have a medium for presentation. The Dalhousie Review is a pursely University publication, and cannot fullfil this function qua students, except in special cases. University students are literate far above the average expected from society generally, and from
them most of our best writing comes today. Unfortunately, very few of them are able to break
into the professional writing feilds for a variety
of reasons. One of the most important of these
reasons is that by far the greater amount of professional writing done today is done for periodicals whose editors insist that their writers should
become hacks who will use the accepted conventions which have sold successfully. Such an attitude

the state of our culture.

It is for the Universities to lead in the fielé
of promoting original work which can genuinely
be called art; no popular magazine can fullfil
this function, and none of them owe any duty

to do so. Dalhousie, whether University orStu

such a magazine should receive considerable support form students generally.

_ The King’s Choral and Dramatie Soeiety did an excellent performance of the difficult, supernatural drama; “The Monkey’s

of the father “Mr. White’”’ to per.
fection. Caroline Marshall, who
_ took the part of tthe mother ‘Mrs.

a difficult part. Danford Kelly,
the son; Robert Muggah, who was

. performances. ©
The Pi Beta-Phi Fraternity presented Roberta Shannon’s “White
Tris” under the able direction of
Wileen Phinney. Peggy Rundle as
“Jessame Doone’ and Jan Sinclair as “Dorcas” deserve credit
for their performances in this ten_
sely dramatic play. Margaret
- Goode, who we remember as
- “Ruth” in “Dear Ruth,” played
the part of Jessame’s sister ‘‘Marcia,” and Beryl Beatty took the
part of “Lucy Clair” extremely
well. It was a nineteenth century
drama, taking place in a small
town near Boston, the one sister
having everything, yet nothing;
the other having nothing, yet
everything.”
The Delta Gramma Society presented J. B. Morris’ ‘Petticoats
Preferred” under the direction of
J. L. Robertson, who made a great
-hit of the play a few years ago.
Holly Flemming as “Teresa” was
the star of the show and deserves
a great deal of praise. Other members of the cast were Bev Huntington as “Maddelena,’’ Ann De
Carteret as “Francesca,” Janet
Cameron as “Angela,” Phyllis
Aitken as “Giavanna” and Caroline Logan as “Nita.” The costummies were very effective but
could have peen brighter. The
team was under the able manageTent of Patty MacKinnon.
. The Arts and Science Society
presented “Send Her Victorious,” written by Phillip Johnson
and directed by Mrs H. Leslie
Pigot. Ken Phelps was excellent
as the enraged husband, being the
best individual actor in the play.
Other members of the cast were
_ Murray MacInnes as “Sinhett,”
Moyra Seeger as “Esta Cardew,”
John Trim as “George Cardew”
and Lorna Innes as ‘Marion

B.C:
Holds Mock
Parliament

An interesting innovation in
mock parliament procedure is to
kL noted at U. B. C. where a
group of students have banded to
form a political party called Whig
Union of Socialist Tories Excepting Stalinist Trotskyites.

The Labor Progressive Party
has withdrawn from the parliament, the L. P. P. president, Norm
Litlewood, declaring “I take the
stand maintained originally by all
four political club leaders — that
the Mock Parliament should be a
serious debate on political idealogy.”

Planks in the WUSTEST program are the following:
1. The turning over of postal and
penal services to private enterprise.

2. The nationalization and contrel
of female fashions.
3. A bill to restrict use of crown
lands to useful citizens.
4. & bill to prohibit or control the
manufacture and sale of toy pistols.

The Forum Leader, Cliff Greer,
meanwhile has declared that the
entrance of the “gag” political

party into Mock Parliament elect- _

ions is “deplorable.”

Of the party points, WUSTEST
chieftain, Art Benson, has declared that the bill to outlaw toy
pistols was designed “to remove
the terrible doubt which hangs
ovr the heads of hold-up victims.
Under the WUSTEST system he
would be certain that the gun
was real. He also advocated turning over postal and penal systems
to free enterprise because “fos
eeconomy reasons... chain gangs
could be used to deliver mail.”

Sodales Holds

New Election

Last Thursday, the Sodales
Society ‘held a second election in

the Munro Room of the Forrest
Building. Elected to official positions for the year 1948-49 were:

Neil McKelvy — President
Earl Urquhart — Vice President
Don Cross — Secretary

Retiring officers are:

Whitney Dalymple — President
Bob Kaill — Vice President
Ivan Cormier — Secretary

The previous Sodales elections,
held Thursday, March 4th, had
been declared invalid when charges that a packed house had been
engineered arose.

The year 1947-48 has been a
very successful one for the
Sodales Society, with the use for
the first time of radio, as a
medium for debating. However,
full use hag not yet been made
of the advantages which Sodales
possesses. For the second time,
the Society has not made use of
a university grant of $150, designed to further public speaking
in Dalhousie. The money has lain
dormant, and has now been put
into the university sinking fund.

THE
DREAMER

Unfortunately for us and the

world we live in, it may still be

said that many men are ignorant
enough to want to stay that way.

I am afraid tthat the Golden
Rule is now tarnished beyond
recognition.

The dreamer is the man among
us who wishes he were what he

isn’t, but leave him to his dreams,
else he will be much less than he

is.

If you refrain from worrying
about death before, you will probably find it quite simple to forget about it after.

When the world
and stands on the brink of utter

has slipped

obliteration it is no time for man
to rest and bless the inches which
yet remain, it is time for him to
exert himself to the extent of his
ability to bring both himself and
his fellow human beings to a saf
er position than was their lot before the fall.
