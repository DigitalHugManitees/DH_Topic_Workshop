Seniors Shine
At Hall Dance

Freshman activities got off to a

rhythmical start at Shirreff Hall last ;

Friday night, when one of Dal’s
largest frosh classes capered and
jived to the rhythmical music of the
Dal Swing Band.

The enthusiasm of the frosh was,
however, surpassed by the eagerness
of the upperclassmen to gain entrance, Though this was strictly a
frosh affair, senior students pleaded
and argued with the initiation committee, pounded at the doors, clambered through the windows and appeared mysteriously in the corridors.

Many an old and well-known perSonality turned up with a dainty

Passed On

RUFUS RAYNE, RANGOON

There passed away silently during the summer months, Rufus
Rayne, leading light in Gazette
features for many years. Brilliant spawn of Bob Maitland, and
a succession of Gazette editors,
his star has been waning for
years, and is now extinguished.

The late Rufus was ruler in his
domain, the Gymnasium, in a
properly autocratic manner. In
a world where democracy is
struggling for survival over dictatorship, no oligarchy was more
unresponsive to its age than that
of Rayne.

His death will come as a shock,
not only to his friends, but to
himself.

Welcome To New Students

Cordially do I welcome you students who have come to us
for the first time. This year you have come to us in large numbers, but what is more important is that I hear—from those

you, and studying your records
—that there is “good stuff” in
your ranks.

Nothing could be more encouraging to us than that. Just as it
is true that the great reputation
of Dalhousie University rests on
the fact that its teaching staff

‘TOWARDS A FRESHMAN INITIATION
Dalhousie’s newest class, one of the largest freshman
$ ever to come to Dalhousie, should provide a sound basis
s and Science society activities, if this class does go the
of its predecessors and fall away from that abstract
ophy to our campus, “college spirit”. In a definite cong majority at Studley, and with the ability to sway the
2s and politics of the non-professional faculties at this
, the latest Freshman class if a unit could add much to

no 1-study of Dalhousie life.
Ty is evidently will not be the case, as it was not before, or
vill be in future years if the same method of initiation is used.

‘rosh expect to be given a real “torture-treatment”, and
bly expect all the upperclassmen have been plotting ways
1eans of initiation before they enter college year.

_ Mentally they come prepared for the worst, and are actually Reannornted wien belaver. So far most of them have
‘essed disappointment because they have not seen any
re spirit, even if such were manifested in the rough treat
of a real freshman initiation.

; r colleges have been noted for theirs; at Acadia the
of Wolfville is given over one night a year to students of
lege. At Dalhousie in former years the youngest class
ken out and put through a real initiation. So far we have
a dull dance at Shirreff Hall, and a few green bow ties,
sh can be picked up on the campus anywhere. Placards are

discarded.

. i

y

There is a dissolute attitude to this so-called college spirit.
basis of enthusiasm for our university has been spread
thin, due to sophistication of the students, and a general lack
of interest at getting involved in student activities.

_ There is actually more expectancy of the freshman fox
initiation than by the upperclassman to bother initiating him.
Tn all Canadian universities the spirit of initiation is waning.
In some cases it is justified moderation; there has been death

lolent injury attending practices of the past.

There is no reason for cutting it out altogether, or placing
it at the minimum where its expected purpose is lost: to unify
hmen into a class, to give them something to remember as
start to college, to teach them they are but minor units in
arge organization, and to wean them away from their home
attitude where they were bigger units in smaller entities.
_ The seniority system of English colleges no longer holds
position in most Canadian universities. We have a broader
caste system in our North American continent, and a definite
urge to individual freedom which is environmental in origin.
The student at this university may have sprung from lowly
r rigin, or may be of different creeds. Dalhousie counts its men
and women for their abilities, and prejudice bars none from
ending classes here.

ip _ There is, however, in the seniority system the elements of
the life after college: position through experience. There is
fight to living, and to reach the goal of ambition everybody has
fight multitudes of people. |
In colleges we are facing the same trials, and our goals
similar to the goals of life; here we strive for knowledge,
1 there we put it into practical application. Nobody can be
fortunate enough to realize position through cloistered abilities,
but has to fight. The freshman is at the bottom of the well
_ of college experience, and to break to the surface waters is a
hard task.
There should be no condemnation for the initiating comtee for their work so far, as responsibility is of the entire
stu dent body, past and present.

_ We do not advocate strenuous measures, no peanut pushing

IARIES

ANONYMOUS

The other day I read of a man
who kept a diary for fifty years. He
died, and in compliance with the
terms of his will, the diary was
burned unread. Could anything be
more infuriating? The situation is
unnatural, almost immoral, like suicide. However, I am less concerned

with the destruction than the com- |.

position of diaries.

First, one must decide whether or
not to be a diarist. That is quite
simple, but what is more difficult is
deciding the kind of record one shall
keep. We all know the neat blank
books carefully dated and spaced so
that each day has for its history
some ten or fifteen iines. To me this
product is the symbol of insolence
among printers and _ bookbinders.
They say in unequivocal languages
that every day of your year is worth
so much and no more, and that if
your work is to be pleasant to the
eye, each day must be recorded and
given as much space as every other
day. No diarist worthy of the name
will accept these premises, but will
procure on absolutely virgin journal,
to do with as he sees fit.

When we write, we presuppose
reading and to some extent concur
with. the tastes of our audience. It
would be inconsiderate, and, in the
end, futile, to write an article in
Sanskrit for an English newspaper
upon the benefits of Nazi rule. The
diarist must decide for whom he is
writing, and govern himself accordingly. If this journal is a secret
history, intended only for his own
use, he may use a cipher. If he
plans to have the journal published,
or at least circulated among his ac
 

 

quaintance, he should keep this object always in mind. But these are
the most superficial matters. What
is really important, what really determines the value of his work is the
self-portrait that the diarist cannot
help paint. No matter what his
literary skill, no matter what efforts
| he makes at concealment (such ef- |
forts are dishonest, whether dohaete
ous or subsconscious) he will leave |
his picture on the page he writes.

If believing that memory is a
leaky vessel, the diarist writes to
preserve his youth for the inspection
| of his old age, and for no other purpose, then he should tell everything.
The pleasures of recollection are a
| solace to senility, and since some
single record will often open long
vistas of the past, there is really
nothing too trivial to be set down in
Besides, we will |
forgive in ourselves the voluminiousness that in others is unbearable. |
This kind ofa journal can embalm
|a whole era, with all its contemporaries,

An equally personal sort of journal
is that in which are formulated the |
thoughts of the writer as he Sits |
considering the retrospect of the |

 

: ; ; |
himself, he will be able to turn back |

and read of his old loves and hates
|} and ambitions, while if he is not
| honest, he will at least have a pretty
tissue of fiction to admire. Natur
| ally, there is a stage in this kind

of dishonesty beyond which fact and
fiction are indistinguishable to their
author.

The merit of the secret journal

| lies in that it is not intended for
| publication; it is a personal record

meant only for the written. A diary

| that is written with publication in

 

mind must be judged by the mr
standard as any other prose work.
The self consciousness of such a |
chronicle gives it the value of being
an intensely personal commentary
on its period, while the psychologist
finds in it an index to the character
of the author. Often what the writer
ignores is as important to the psychologist as what he treats fully.
The published diary is the outcome
of the author’s urge to tell the whole
world what he has done, where he
has been, what as happened to him,
and why he has behaved so.

The politician publishes his memoirs so that people may know he
was misjudged and misinterpreted.
The priest prints the unsatisfactory
arguments he has had with himself
in the hope that the public will
realize that the best man won. The
socialite does the same so that others

of the race will know he (very often
she) has met all the best people,
and is consequently acceptable in any
society. The saint and the sinner
share the same reason for publishing their diaries: they exhibit their
lives for the admiration and emulation of the common herd.

These published journals are so
one sided their value in any question of history or morals is hegligible, unless with them is taken into
consideration all the mass of material dealing with their period. In
many cases it is the secret diary,
written in code, kept under lock and
key during the writer’s life, and
somehow escaping the destruction he
intended at his death, that contains
the truth that published memoirs of
the same period profess to tell. The
very act of publication and circulation is in itself suspicious; it indicates some purpose other than purely
personal satisfaction in writing, as
well as an exhibitionism caused by
Some straining for recognition or
justification. The writer of a secret
history cares little for public opinion
and as often as not has no reason
for courting it. Any printed material is an attempt on the public,
and in order to make this attempt
successful, the writer must always
diverge from the completely honest
and candid style of the secref writer.

Previously I said that it was. a
simple matter to decide whether or
not to be a diarist. This was perhaps too generous a statement, for when we realize that considerable
time and some talent must be expended upon any diary (I do not
mean those daily notations of wéather and the price of eggs) our literary
ardor is likely to be damped. It is
well to remember that the diary is
only a record, and not a life in itself. It is as ridiculous to surrender
to mechanical writing in a diary as
to arrange life so that it would look
well on the diary page. It is not
necessary to have any’ fixed rule: of
time or place concerning your entries, nor is it desirable to have a
scale of importance by which events
are judged worthy of entry. The obviously important should be written
down, but there are many amusing
trivialities that should also be preserved for your later enjoyment.
Few lines are really monotonous, and
while there may be days or even
weeks while there is little to report,

|a careful sifting of what material

there is may reveal those incidents
that, although they are not soulshaking, are at least entertaining.

The journal should consist not only
of incident, but also of your reaction to it. We learn by experience,
but it is often wise to make some
note of our increasing knowledge so
that we can appreciate our improvement. It must be very pleasant tc
turn back the pages to some parallel
Situation and to see how much better
we behaved at the latter time.

We are often told by priests and
doctors that confession is good for
the soul. The office of father confessor is one that the diary fills
wonderfully. The secret journals of
all ages are filled with. material that,
if the writer were not beyond emo:
tion, would cause them intense embarrassment > at being discovered.”
But this only proves there are perSonal crises too great to be kept
entirely inside the heart, and the
diary is the safest reservoir into

were announced two other new appointments, that of Gordon
S. Cowan to teach a considerable part of Dean MacDonald’s
subjects, and Leonard W. Fraser, to lecture in Constitutional
Law. As a result of business in down town firms of these appointees, Dalhousie Law students will go to classes a half hour

earlier in the morning.

Dean Vincent C. MacDonald, Weldon Memorial Professor of Law, has
been given leave of absence for the
duration of the war to act as Assistant Deputy Minister in the Department of Labor. His duties of

Summer Weddings Feature Thirteen Collegiates—

Dalhousie Students Fall
In Scores Before Cupid

Dalhousians fell thickly before the machine-gun wielded by
Cupid during the summer months. Of nine weddings reported,
four were exclusively Dal, which is proof that college friendships can be the most lasting amities. Two of the men are
medical students, one an Arts grad in French, and the other a
graduate Law student now in the Army. Nine Dalhousie girls
were married, indicating the Dalhousie male student has a
decided preference for the campus female. Of the outside marriages by Dalhousie women, four males were in the services and
the fifth belongs to a rival college. Following is a brief description of the summer’s weddings. Dalhousie congratulates:

BURNIE

Coach “Burnie” Ralston needs
little introduction to the new students, for the very good reason that
the genial physical director is as
well known off the campus as on.
Burnie was born in. Shelburne in
1912, where he took his grade school
work, later coming to Halifax for
his early High School training. In
1929 he graduated from Saint John
High, a four-letter man in sport.

From here on his career follows
the course which every young man
dreams of but seldom attains. At
Acadia University Burnie was a
leading student and his concern with
the gentle art of basketball established, much of the Axemen’s reputation in the game. He graduated
in 1933 with a Bachelor of Science
degree, having established a reputation which has been seldom equalled
as an outstanding athlete in football, track and field, basketball and |
aquatics.

_ Burnie led thé Saint John Seniors’

short field berth on the Ketepec! for the success of Physical Educa- |
Aces, New Brunswick softball cham- |

pions. Then he played a year of
Soccer with the St. Andrews Club
and some baseball with the St. John
Baptist nine. In one season Burnie
tallied three-quarters of his team’s
points in the regular football season. While in Saint John Burnie
played with the “Dry Docks” and
later with the “Post Royals”.

In 1989 Burnie was awarded the | |
Clark award, given to the outstand-| - rey Ge meee

forty-one of fifty votes. That award Crrrecie Chis to Be ’

“HOLD YOUR HORSES”

Farmers at country stores years ago used to be given
the alarm “Hold Your Horses” when anyone started to
use the telephone. The animals were frightened by the
shouting that was then necessary in order to be heard
over the telephone.

Today, whether you call across the street or across
the continent, you can talk in your normal tone of voice.
Telephoning makes possible the simultaneous sending and

receiving of important war messages so vital to the
nation today.
