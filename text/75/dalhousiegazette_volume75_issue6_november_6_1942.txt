Dal Students Will Bury Frosh Show Monday Night

Axes; Team Chances Good Opens Glee

A return encounter and probable same hospitality will be
held tomorrow afternoon at 3.30 when Dalhousie Tigers collegiately tangle with the Acadia Axemen. For Dalhousie the
game offers possibilities of redemption from other defeats.
While there is little chance of Tigers getting anywhere in the
League this year, having suffered two defeats, by beating the
Acadia team, who are striving to keep on a par with the highflying Navy team, partial revenge for their defeat last Saturday will be achieved.

The Dalhousie Glee Club will present its first show of the year, when
the annual Freshman entertainment
takes place Monday night. A staraspirant cast of the freshmen and
freshettes have been working for
weeks on their show, which will take
the form of a revue. The opening

Dalhousie students, roused to a fighting fever by the

the fall meeting of the Board of
Regents of Mount Allison Friday,

hour is eight, and dancing will continue afterwards to 12 o’clock, with

hospitality meted out on the other campus, will enter the game
as players or spectators with a will for victory. A giant Pep
Rally is being held tonight (story, p. 3) and everybody will
have a chance to show they are behind the team and the college
by turning out for the game.

 

The Dalhousie lineups have not

Surprise acts will be given, and

there was plenty of good music ard

A few shouts of praise wil] liven
the Tigers to a jungle edge. Observers, more critical than the optimistic who forget the Acadia victory
was won only after a hard twothirds game struggle, have given
Tigers a little under a half and half
chance to topple Axemen.

 

The report of the committee will be
finalized at a meeting to be held on

Sodales to Hold
Trials on Thursday

At a conference of the Maritime
Intercollegiate Debating League, held
at the University of New Brunswick
at Fredericton, Dalhousie was chosen to debate, during the coming
year, with Saint Francis Xavier,
Mount Alliison and Acadia. Trials
for the opening debate, to be held
November 30 at Saint Francis
Xavier, will be held next Thursday,
November 12.

Intercollegiate debates, conducted
under the auspices of the M.I.D.L.,
are open to both men and women
students, undergraduate or postgraduate, who are regularly enrolled
in at least three classés. At Dalhousie, each debate is worth five
points to the participants towards a
gold “D”, and no person may debate
in more than one M.I.D.L. match in
any one year.

The inclusion of women students
under the M.I.D.L. constitution is an
innovation which has already been
successfully tried out at Dalhousie.
Last spring, a team composed of
Miss Eileen Mader and Edmund
Morris debated with an Acadia team.
It is hoped that the interest displayed in debating in the past by the
women students will be increased
this year, thus affording the Sodales
Debating Society strong representation in forthcoming debates.

The trials which are to be conducted next Thursday are arranged
for the selection of three teams of
two debators each, with two alterThus, all the participants

of the Student Christian Movement.

And Many The Hearts
That Were Broken...
After The BALL

The hallowed precincts of Shirreff
Hall rang with joie de vivre last
night, as the residence girls held
their annual Formal. Usual procedure of Dal dances was reversed,
ala Sadie Hawkins, with the women
inviting the males of their choice,
without fear or favor, although possibly with an eye to forthcoming
festivities in which the men will
play, and pay, in their accustomed
role. No heart-broken males had
been reported up to Gazette press
time last night, ,but the little pig
would probably be able to get a

were here.

Saturday morning at the ’witching

Axemen’s hide-out, i.e. more than
50 miles from a certain E. Coast port
it was impossible to hire a bus as
per the custom of former years, and
so, another victim of the Beast of
Berlin, Dallians made the trip by

All members of the Dalhousie Fac

a good number took advantage of
their invitations, including President
Stanley. Most of the Dal girls were
saccessful in hunting down the elusive male, and turned up with escorts. In spite of a reported movement among Med students to omit
the traditional corsage, a good proportion of the women sported the
floral tribute. The men wore the

me There have been dozens of enlistments in all branches of the
___ Armed Forces, and Dalhousie-trained technicians take unlauded,
_ but nonetheless heroic, posts at the vital cogs of industry. On
all foreign fields fighting men are maintaining the glorious

____-‘no more: Governmental decree has denied that. We may never
__ rettirn to this observance.

_ There is, however, one tribute always possible for those
_ who fell or will fall in the service of our King and country. It
is simple, but impressive. It also serves its purpose. Who has
‘never seen a flag at half mast without the experience of paie triotic emotion, and deeper and more primitive than that, if it
is death through struggle, the instinctive feeling of obligation
to some person, known or unknown, who has passed away

__-was through aiding this cause.

to this purpose. It as a centre between a

UNNECESSARY EXPENSE

(from a sartorial point of view)

Mademoiselle at the dances, that gay creature of the pre‘war world, where civilization was at a lackadaisical height, and
_ perfume and all the accoutrements of the modern miss
, cherchant pour Vhomme. were necessary, is to disappear. In_ Stead the modern Dalhousie co-ed may well expect her escort

_ Wartime economy, and the girls will not create too much of a
fuss about it.

iL. That is the decided opinion of most of the male students,
__ and the girl friend will have to fit with such. Whereas there
| has been a decided controversy in the past about the corsage
_. question, war has brought the question into the open.

__,,,Whatever the pro and con of the peacetime argument, there

is little to be said for corsages in war. It is expensive to buy
these graceful additions to milady’s makeup; once they are
used they last but little time before they wilt.

_ _ Last year at the gigantic Red Cross Ball the campus held,
___-corsages were sold at a special booth, with proceeds going to
_____War purposes. The war effort suffered not. While we do not
advocate the nationalization of flower shops because of the war

_ Students, those who bear the expense, that this is an unwanted
and unworthy burden.

REMEMBER FOREVER
(11th November, 1942)

Remember, forever, the sons of the fearless,
Who sacrificed freely their souls to the fight;

The conquest of sin, through the sword, their employment,
Redemption of righteousness, sought with their might.

Remember, forever, their faith o’er the struggle,

And trust that these efforts were ne’er sought in vain ;
Youth, set to strive ’gainst the realm of evil,

To vanish in part, with the spoils of their fame.

Remember, forever, the One who reigns o’er us,

In Him stood their strength, in His cause did they die:
And never forget, through the years, of their passing—
Atonement, at last, with the Saviour on high.

BOOKPLATES

Those zealous students who have. Nicholas Bacon and Sir Thomas
visited Macdonald Library and are| Tresham (1585).

acquainted with the books therein, |

will surely have noticed that in
most, or perhaps all the books, there
is to be found on the inner side of
the fro:it cover or on the flyleaf, or
both, one or two decorative labels
indicating the ownership or purpose
of the book. Two of the most common labels or bookplates are those
of the Dalhousie College Library
and the late Doctor Archibald MacMechan. Most students are content
to glance at these labels or pass
them by, unaware that back of these
small pieces of paper there is a most
fascinating tale.

The bookplate or “ex-libris”, as it
is commonly called, “is nearly as
old as the printed book itself. It
bears much the same relation to the
hand-painted armorial or otherwise
symbolical personal device found in
mediaeval manuscripts, that the
printed page does to the scribe’s
work.”

The earliest ex-libris are German.
The oldest movable ex-libris are
connected with the name of Frederick Warnecke of Berlin. They are
certain hand-painted woodcuts representing a shield of arms supported
by. an angel. which were pasted in
books presented to :the Carthusian
“onastery, of, Buxheim by Brother
1480, Aina it
osThe earliest: bookplate ‘ino Fran
was that’ of Jean “Bertaude de la
Tour-Blanche, 1529. In Holland the
bookplate of Anna -van der Aa, 1597,
is the earliest. The earliest in Italy
dates back to 1622. The plain, printed label of John Williams, 1679, is
the earliest in America. In England
the earliest ex-libris has been found
in some books presented to Cambridge University by Sir Nicholas
Bacon,

,

“A sketch of the history of the|
bookplate, either as a minor work of |

symbolical or decorative art, or as

| an accessory to the binding of books,
must obviously begin in Germany, |

not only because the earliest examples known are German, but also
because they are found in great
numbers long before the fashion
spread to other countries, and are
often of the highest artistic interest.”

Albrecht Durer is known to have

completed at least six ex-libris be-|

tween 1503-1516. Designs have also
been ascribed to Lucas Cranach and
Hans Holbein, the ‘Little Masters,
and others.

The influence of these draughts
Until the last quarter of the sev| enteenth century, English bookplates were limited in composition,
simple, and lacking German elaborateness. They were very plainly
armorial, the decoration consisting
of a simple arrangement of mantling (drapery-like ornamentation
surrounding an escutcheon) with occasional palms and wreaths.

Soon after the Restoration, bokplates became established as being
accessory to well-ordered libraries.
The mantling in the plates became
more elaborate and recalls the periwig of the period. This style was
undoubtedly imported from France,
but assumes its own character in
England. From this period until the
dawn of the French Revolution, English models follow at a few years’
distance those of France.

The ex-libris of the Queen Anne
and early Georgian periods with
their ornamental frames suggest
carved oak. There was a reduction
in the use of mantling, but more armorial display. The inclusion of the
scollop shell hinted of the “rococo”
(Racaille-Cogille) or Chippendale
fashions of the next regn.

In the middle third of this century
this style affects ex-libris as everything else. ~ More fanciful arrangements of scroll and shell work appeared as well as spreading acanthus sprays. Straight or concentric
linés and the appearance of flat surfaces tend to disappear, as do helmets and rich mantlings. The earliest examples of this period were
apt to be ponderous and simple, but
as the period drew to a close the exlibris might be found to contain anything from cupids to Chinese pagodas.

During the early part of George
IIl’s reign there was a return to
greater sobriety of ornamentation.
A more truly national style appears
in the use of the urn as the theme
of the ex-libris. Bookplates of this
period recall such designers as Ad
 

 

men has been felt on decorative
styles of Germany down to the present day, in spite of Italian and
French fashions of the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries and -the
marked effort at originality of the
present day.

Not before the seventeenth century. was the movable ex-libris very
common in France. Book owners
preferred the more luxurious habiit
of stamping the covers of their
books with personal devices. From
the middle of the century the exlibris came into its own. The ex.
pression “ex-libris” used as a subStantive found its origin in France.

The story of the English bookplate from the age of Elizabeth to
that of Victoria is particularly interestin. “In all its varieties it reflects with great fidelity the prevailing taste in decorative art in
different epochs.” Some of the earlest examples of the ex-libris in Eng
_ land belonged to the libraries of Sir
a 2

‘
pee
fe

ams, Wedgewood, Hepplewhite and
Sheraton. The shield of the ex-libris
shows a plain spade-like outline,
based on the pseudo-classic urn then
in force. The ornamentation was
Symetrically arranged with the shield
of arms subsidiary to the urn.

From the beginning of the nine
teenth century until the present no
special style has been established.
Most of the ex-libris of this period
show a plain shield of arms with a
motto or scroll below and a crest or
fillet above. In the years following
immediately on the birth of the
twentieth century there was a new
interest in the designing of ex-libris.

The interest in bookplates and the
value attached to them and the
study and collection of them does
not date earlier than 1875. In 1880
Lord de Tabley (Hon. Leicester
Warren) published a book entitled
“A Guide to the Study of Bookplates”. Until modern times the
heraldic stationer has designed exlibris. However, the heraldic element has become subsidiary to the
allegorical or symbolic.

Today every person who aspires
to a well-ordered library feels that
his library is not complete until his
ownership is indicated in his books
by some attractive bookplate usually designed .by himself. This is all
the more important if an owner of
books is cursed with a few friends
who are guilty of that most pernicious habit of keeping borrowed
books until the covers literally drop
off, L. W. C,

The younger you are when you

So, you should start thinking

Will you need insurance? Yes—
unless you intend to live like a
hermit without human contacts and
responsibilities. One day you may
have a home of your own.to keep,
a family to provide for. One day

you will certainly need money for
your own retirement.

There are Mutual Life policies
that can do all these things. When

Dave Frost Tells Of
i War Torn Shanghai
|

By DOUG McLEOD.

Note: Dave Frost is an Engineering freshman at Dalhousie
this year. He is studying with
intention of continuing in Engineering. He was born in Shanghai
in 1925. He lived there until 1941
at which time he came to Canada
with his family landing at North
Sydney. He hereby presents the
history of the City of Shanghai
as related to Doug MacLeod,
Gazette reporter.

This old city was made a treaty
port in 1842, and with the development of foreign trade, its area was
greatly extended. To the North of
the ancient Chinese city, there grew
up the modern International Settlement,. occupied by European and
American interests. Numerous improvements were made; the harbour
was modernized, the settlement with

its broad, clean streets, fine homes |

and hotels, handsome shops, department stores, banks and business
houses, became the wonder city of
the east.

The native section, however, remained typically Chinese, overcrowded and unsanitary.

The Japanese first obtained a
foothold by bribing the Chinese
police. These traitors were called,
“TaoTao men.” They were under

the leadership of “Wang Ching |
These traitors lived in a sec- |
tion of the city known as the bad- |
a maze of |

Wei.”

lands. It consisted of

alleys and slums. Chinese were be

ing killed continuously by these)
traitors to the government. |
The Japanese immigrated such

great numbers of their people into
the countryside surrounding the city

that the Chinese people were forced

to keep moving in on the city in
order to have room in which to live.
In addition to the Chinese traitors
there were Chinese terrorists. These
men would continue to kill Japanese.
This would result in the entry of
the Japanese militia into the area
and the erection of a state of blockade on the street or area.
related how on one occasion, after

such a killing by a terrorist, the |

Japanese blockade prevented his fa
ther from getting to work for three |

days.

In addition to the blocking of the
streets, the Japanese would murder
the Chinese soldiers. They would
shoot them in the stomach and leave
them to die a slow death in the
street. Mr. Frost recalled driving to
school many times with the sight of
blood on every side.

On one occasion, the Japanese
dropped two bombs on the International settlement. This was in 1937.
They claimed that the action was
purely accidental in spite of the fact
that two thousand people were
killed.

With the coming of the Chinese
immigrants from the country, the
congestion was beyond imagination.

The Prospects
~ Of Victory

by DR. N. A. M. MacKENZIE

It is interesting and useful to ask
oneself occasionally the question:
How is the war going? What are
our prospects of victory? For if we
do so, sincerely and intelligently,
we can get a better idea of what
lies ahead of us and what we should
individually and _ collectively do
about it. My own opinion has been,
that if the Russians could hold the
Germans, and the Chinese, British
and Americans, the Japanese until

winter comes then they will not be |

able to defeat us.

As winter is fast approaching, it
seems that we are still holding and
fighting back despite desperate losses. They, our enemies, will have to
face another winter of stalemate and
suffering and an allout offensive in
the spring. The Russians, however,
have lost men, equipment, territory,
population and resources on a very
large scale to the Germans. The
British, Dutch and Americans have
been equally unfortunate in their
losses to the Japanese. This adds
up to the conclusion, that since our
enemies have not been able to defeat and destroy us when we were
almost totally unprepared, they will
not be able to defeat us at all.

But the question: Can we defeat
them? still remains. The answer to
this question depends on how quickly
we can mobilize all our resources,

|men, materials, industry and morale,

and how wisely we use these resources. Once again it is a race
against time. The Germans have
gained control of almost all of the
resources of Europe. Japan has gathered in the Empire of South East
Asia and the Pacific Islands. If they
can organize and consolidate these

'new empires before we defeat them,

then the outcome of the war will be
stalemate—a precarious balance of
power, and another world war in a
few years time!

If we can get the productive capacity of the United States, the British
Commonwealth, and the other United
Nations up to maximum capacity by
the spring of 1943 and use that production with courage, skill and audacity, we can beat our enemies and
win the war. That is why I consider

|it so important for everyone to do
| and give and produce his and her

utmost within the next few months
and to keep on doing, giving and
producing at maximum capacity.
The struggle will be long and hard,
the sacrifices and losses heavy and
hard to bear, but if we put all that
we have into it, this winter should
see us over the crest of the hill that
leads ultimately to Victory.

 

 

 

The refuse ‘and. litter of all kinds
usually disposed of in a sanitary
fashion was simply dumped in the
streets.

Up until 1941 Mr. Frost related
how British and Italian troops patrolled the streets side by side in
spite of the fact that their countries were themselves at war. In
late 1941, condiditions became so
bad that the British and American
troops were forced to evacuate.
With the bombing of Pearl Harbour
on Dec. 7, 1941, the Japanese, work
ing as if on some pre-arranged plan,
took over the whole of the city of
Shanghai.

Mr. Frost is willing to answer any
questions which the readers of the
Gazette may have in connection with
this famous and historic city. He
speaks from personal experience and

is well versed in conditions in China.

With Acadians still in classes as

both Freshman and Sophomore classes on two alternate days, apparently
justified by the fact that the competitors had been at college so long

At other Maritime universities the
emphasis is slightly different. Every
possible player—good or bad—gets a
chance at the game. True it is that
this doesn’t enhance the precision
playing in any one game, but then it
has its merits. And I like the practice at St. F. X., which incidentally
does very well in any competition.
During the 45-minute interval between lunch and afternoon classes,
about twelve footballs or basketballs
depending on the season, are in constant motion and everyone on the
campus takes a hand.

Apropos of recent deaths among
well-known alumni, what has happened to the flag? Maybe it’s because “Red” Payne, who would
certainly have known better, was
not around. It might be an idea
worthy of consideration to have
someone else know a few of the
minor details about the campus. At
any rate, the flag should be flown at
half-mast when a student dies as
well as an alumni or ex-faculty
member.

There is an old French proverb
which says that any old time is a
