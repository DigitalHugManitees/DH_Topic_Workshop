With a Heads

"Bradent Activities Pi isidered

THIS WEEK, one of the most momentous events con- eerning Students’ Activities at Dal took place in the Senate

Room, where a Faculty Committee met with heads of the
major Students’ Societies. Of main interest to the students
is the news that the Senate Athletic and Gym Committee has
been rejuvenated and its present membrship—Prof. Maxwell
(Chairman), Prof. Theakston (Secretary), Dean Wilson,
Dean Grant, and Prof. Bean—have already taken an active
nearer t in carrying out its duties.

 

With 220 Copies Sold,
Year Book Staff
Predicts Banner Year

@ A SUCCESSFUL season for
Pharos, the Dalhousie year book,
is indicated this year. So far, 220

“books have been sold, and with a

new office in the basement of the
Arts building, the large efficient
staff is driving ahead to make this
an unparalleled year for this new
and better edition

In the attempt ©
to improve the
year book, the
Students’ Council
has appointed a
special committee
to look into all
with it and to
make recommendations on their
findings. The intention is to make
the book larger
and more useful to the students,
with more pictures, better layouts,
and better copy. The committee appointed consists of Bill Pope, chairman, Lois Ratee, and Doug Clarke.
The committee met for the first
time last Friday and decided to put
on an immediate drive to sell more
copies of Pharos. The drive will
be supervised by Jim Bell, who has
been authorized to appoint a huge
new sales staff so that the largest
number of copies possible may be
sold. The success of the year book
depends on the number of orders
received, so all who possibly can
are asked to subscribe immediately.

_ Pietures By Christmas

Senior students are requested to
get their pictures taken before
Christmas if possible. They may
be done by any Halifax photographer at approximately $2.

The committee is recommending
to the Students’ Council the awarding of gold and silver Ds to the
staff of Pharos. The matter is to
come up before the next meeting
of the council and is expected to
be passed.

; DANCING

@ TWO INFORMAL dances will
be held in the Common Room of
the Men’s Residence tomorrow, the
first commencing at 4 p.m. and
lasting to 6 p.m., the second at 9
p.m. and concluding at midnight.
Music will be supplied by Don
Warner’s sextet. All members of
the student body are admitted free
of charge.

 

The Senate has conferred all of
its powers, regarding athletics, upon this committee and already the
committee has held meetings with
the heads of the physical departments and with the student heads.

Representing the students were
Larry Sutherland, Student Council
President; Miss Virginia Phillips,
President of the D.G.A.C.; Don
Harris, D.A.A.C. President; Harry
Zappler, Glee Club President; Alex
Farquhar, Student Gym Committee
Chairman, and Bill Mingo, Gazette
Editor.

Activities Reported
The meeting began with reports
of the activities of the various organizations, followed by questions

from the Senate members, and as

a result of this discussion, several
recommendations were brought forward.

Among the recommendations was
a suggested increase in Student
Council fees, in order to finance
increased activities at Dal. From
the D.G.A.C. came a recommendation that their activities receive
more attention and support. Upper
class girls, it was urged, should
take a more active part in their
society’s programme.

Practice Hours A Problem

Chief problem of the D. A. A.C.
is to obtain convenient practice
hours for senior sport. A proposal
was made to have classes remain
at the three o’clock starting hour
for afternoon classes, and an answer will be fortheoming shortly.
The Glee Club reported very enthusiastic support, but it also suffered from lack of practice time.

No immediate solution could be.

suggested, but a future meeting
would discuss the matter more
thoroughly.

DELTA GAMMA TO
TAKE ACTION

@ DURING the summer months
the Dalhousie Alumnae very kindly
redecorated the girls’ common
rooms in the Arts and Forrest
buildings. The girls should show

‘their appreciation to these ladies

by each and everyone doing her
best to keep these rooms tidy, by
using wastepaper baskets and ashtrays which are provided. The
executive of Delta Gamma _ will
have to take steps to impose fines
unless some improvement is noticed
at once.

® THERE WILL be a meeting of
the Junior Class on Tues., Oct. 30,
at 12 o’clock in Room 3 of the Arts
Building. Agenda: Junior Prom.

Hickman Outshouts Miffin to Win
Decision In Car Parking Lot Case

@ LAST WEEK the decision in
Ashby v. Tolhurst came up on appeal before a distinguished bench
on which sat A. H. Butler L,.CWJ.,
R. J. McCleave L.J., and McKay
L.J. Hickman K.C. supported the
appeal while Mifflen K.C. supported
the respondents. The question of
law was whether, when you put
your car in a car parking lot and
do not hand over the keys of the
car, does possession pass to the
owner of the lot in order to place

“upon him the responsibility of tak
ing care of the car?

Hickman’s Argument

Mr. Hickman’s argument reminded one of a clever prizefighter .. .
weaving, waving his hands, some
times threateningly, sometimes ca~’

jolingly and sometimes defensively,
always parrying and sidestepping
questions which were thrown at
him by the court, He refused to
be bullied and persisted in out
oe _ shouting: thei Tovdahips whenever

they asked him a question. Mr.
Hickman expressed no great respect for the vast knowledge of the
law which is usually attributed to
judges of this court, but he had
a complete grasp of the law on the
case and gave a very strong and
appealing argument for the appellant. Mr. Mifflen, K.C. was a
tower of strength for the respondent. His tactics were not those of
his learned friend: Many of his
arguments were irrefutable, being
quietly and carefully brought out
and based on strong authority.
Butler L.C.J. upheld the appeal,

and was supported by McKay L.J.

McCleave L.J. dissented. For the
most part decorum was maintained
throughout the proceedings, but
the conduct of some was disgraceful. Hartling, a lowly junior,
deigned to come into our high
tribunal without a necktie. Hart
‘and Yoeman went to sleep, and
McLellan was found to be reclining
against a window.

D.A.A.C. . Constitution
Amendments Passed
At Stormy Meeting

@ D.A.A.C. held a special meeting
last Tuesday to present proposals
of amendments to the constitution
of the Club. Don Harris, president,
met with considerable opposition in
the proposal to make the managers
of interfaculty sports leagues eligible for the award of a silver ‘D’.

Heated discussion followed the
reading of the amendment
Doug Clarke, former D.A.A.C.

president, objected strenuously to
the award of the silver ‘D’ to the
league managers on the grounds
that it was out of proportion to
the ‘D’s awarded to Senior sports
players.

Nicholson Speaks

Jack Nicholson claimed that too
much attention was given to “gold
‘D’s, silver ‘D’s, and Major ‘D’s,”
and not enough to the playing of
the sports. “I have the right to
speak, and I am going to speak”,
he shouted, and proceeded ‘to air
his views to the meeting. The
president asked him why he had
not brought the matter up at an
executive meeting and Nicholson
replied, “I just thought about it
now”. The proposed amendment
was finally put to a vote and was
carried.

Other amendments to the constitution of D.A.A.C., all of which
were carried with only slight opposition were: That any member,
regardless of previous experience,
be eligible to participate in interfaculty sports, provided he is not a
member of a senior team for that
year in the same sport. That a
senior sports player must play 75%
of the games and practices to be
eligible for a major felt ‘D’,
otherwise getting a minor felt ‘D’.
That the physical instructor of the
university be made a permanent
member of the D.A.A.C. Managing
Committee, the appointment to be
ratified yearly. That the by-laws
of the club may be amended or repealed by a two-thirds vote of
members present at any regular or
special meeting, provided one
week’s notice of such amendment
be given.

To Pay Hospitalization Costs

The meeting also approved a
resolution asking the Students’
Council for a $100 appropriation to
cover the expenses of an operation
made necessary for Bryce Burgess
as a result of a face injury received in last Saturday’s football game,

Dahlousie Hoe Down

@ WITH GREAT effort, last Monday night, a small group was assembled in the gym to practice the
ancient art of square-dancing.
With the help of Doug Roy and
Don Warner, masters of old Cape
Breton tunes, the participants had
soon worn themselves out. However, everyone had a good time.
The point of this is that we
should be prepared for our -frolics
on Munro Day, and such other
times of gaiety, so that there will
be a bit of organized square dancing instead of the jumbled that resulted in previous years. We are
asking you to come and take part
in-these practices, Monday nights
before badminton. Everyone is
welcome and the more the merrier.

 

Prof. Mercer Hon.
President of Sodales

@ MEMBERS of the Sodales Debating Society rounded up their
business at a meeting Thursday,
choosing our pedagogue of French
and German, Professor Mercer, as
Honorary President, and laying
down the law on future debates.

In choosing
Professor Mercer,

s keen interest he

| The motion was

§ of 9 to 4.
It was felt that
a keener interest
should be taken
in interfaculty debating. In order
to promote this, Gordie Black moved that all participants in the
intercollegiate trials be aecepted
on the condition that they had
volunteered for the interfaculty
competitions. The motion was
seconded by Don Harris and passed
by the assembly.

The debates and Round Table
will be held together this year.
Don Harris, chairman of the
Round Table outlined the weekly
program. The debates will commence at 7.00, the prominent
speaker will speak at about 8.30,
which will be followed by the radio
topic at 9.80, and at 10.00 the subject will be thrown to open discussion.

The society will be represented

Dear Fellow Dalhousians:
On behalf of Dalhousie Alumni
Association, I cordially invite you
to meet with us at a Smoker to
be held in the Dalhousie Gymnasium on the evening of Wednesday, November 7 at eight o’clock.
Many of you have attended the
Smokers of the past two years and

the Student Body and the Alumni,
along with a bountiful supply of
smokes and refreshments will contribute..to a big evening.

This is a big year at Dalhousie.
We have the largest enrolment in
the history of the University and
Many
boys whom we have missed in recent years are at Dal after service
in the Armed Forces. Dalhousie
Spirit should be at its highest ebb.

LAST MONDAY NIGHT, in a little room

ominent members of the faculty of the

students, the leaders of the various campus

rangements in the schedule of classes to permit more time for athletics.

At long last the faculty as a body have
taken official notice of the fact that more
goes on between the four boundaries of this
campus than the attending of lectures and
labs and the reading of books. At long last
they have openly recognized that that part of
a university education which teaches a student
to adjust himself successfully to the society
of his fellows is a vital one. Dr. Kerr placed
it second only to the academic part when
speaking upon the subject in his welcoming
address, and he was not wrong.

As Dalhousians we have a right to be
proud. The academic standards of our institution are as high, and in special fields even
higher than those of the larger universities
in the country. Our student body boasts a
healthy size, large enough to support every
variety of campus activity; yet not a large as
to prohibit each member from knowing most
of his fellows, and thus make impossible that
fresh, cheery spirit of neighbourliness never
found in big communities.

The result is that Dalhousians have a personality of their own; a personality evolved
through years of mixing with each other in
perfect liberty—away from the cramping restraints of antiquated systems of education
that passed out with the turn of the century
and ought to have stayed out with it; a personality bursting with vitality, human imagination, and the bright, wholesome instincts
of mankind. Whatever the faculty do to encourage this atmosphere the students can not
too much appreciate.

So very present in their eyes,
And on their lips a melody divine.
Yes, there was hope,

And life and joy
Beyond gaiety,
pleasure,

Deep and soul-abiding,

The light to guide them

Through the ending night

And on beyond the darkness

To the hope and light of day.

LETTERS to
The Editor

SSE RS

Dear Editor:
The cessation of hostilities and

 

subsequent increase of enrollment

at Dalhousie, coupled with the lifting of wartime restrictions such as

compulsory military training,
should result in a boon to the college spirit for which the University

was at one time famous. The field
of sport offers us an excellent opportunity to display spirit, both as
participants in the different games
and also as supporting spectators.

The expected
college spirit at Dalhousie has not
yet made itself apparent. Exceptionally large crowds are turning
out to watch the rugby matches;
but the Dal supporters spread
themselves out the entire length of
the grandstands and make it very
difficult, often impossible, for
cheerleaders to lead any organized
yells, It might be added that a
great many of the spectators are
interested solely in the game, paying little or no attention to pleas
for support from the stands. The
team counts for a lot in deciding
victory or defeat; but the backing
of that team given by the student
on the sidelines is just as essential.

I would like to suggest that at
future rugby matches, the Dalhousie student body seat themselves in a compact group in the
centre of the north stands and give
their wholehearted support to their
cheerleaders. It is quite possible to
cheer for the team and watch the
game at the same time, and in so
doing the students will see a much
better brand of rugby, with more
victories, for our Dalhousie Tigers.

Yours sincerely,
JOHN BOUDREAU.

CANADIAN
CAMPUS

@® FOR FIVE sad years we’ve been
hearing about the lonely Canadian
co-ed and many and tragic haye
been the tales of the manpower
shortage. But ... WAS there a
shortage? The trans-Canada response has set us to wondering.

ee gp

 

University of New Brunswick
Reports

The manpower shortage is something strange to us. The New
Brunswick campus has never suffered from one. Even during the
war the men have outnumbered the
women four to one, so, the influx
of veterans doesn’t mean the expected new lease on life for wallflowers. Actually it aggravates an
already serious co-ed power shortage.

The typical co-eds are saying:

“Everywhere we go we lead a
parade of desperate men.”

“Tt really is an awful strain.”

“We never get time to work.”

* ee

University of Manitoba
Reports .

Co-ed reaction is not evident
here. Most girls have noticed no
shortage. Arts girls says the increase creates a more stimulating
atmosphere in classes et cetera,
but especially et cetera.
girl says it awfully nice. Science
man deplores it. Home-Ec girls
says at last she can find somedne
to practise her economy on. The
only girl in Engineering says
“Huba Huba Huba!”

* *

University of Alberta

The reaction of the Alberta coeds to the end of the manpower
shortage is generally, “We are not
particularly thrilled. There are
lots of men around, but they are
not overly co-operative.”

Contrary to popular expectations
many of the girls are not having
heavy dates, and at some of the
campus dances stag lines of girls
have been in evidence. The girls
feel that the returned men at
Varsity keep to themselves for the
most part and they are not especially interested in dating the campus belle. In fact, one co-ed when
questioned on the subject, asked
with surprise, “Oh, has there been

an end to the manpower shortage
yet?”

Role of Peanut in Post-War

nuts,’ quoth Professor Rickets by way of introducing his distinguished guest to assembled faithful of the Square-Bench

“Sir Pumpernickle, who is acting assistant vice3usiness Bureau of Margarine-On
The-Crumpet, has made a life study of the peanut. He is the
author of the celebrated ‘‘Let’s Appreciate the Peanut” series,
(Smith & Cohen, $7.50), holds the world’s record for peanutbrittle consumption, and was knighted for his work in preserving Empire ties through a common understanding of the com

“Whether it be salted or otherwise, the peanut will play a decisive
role in the post-war,” Sir Pumpernickle began. ‘“‘I foresee the day
when world statesmen will look to
the peanut for their inspiration.
As they chew on its nutty goodness
at cabinet meetings they will be
aware that in that humble little
edible lies the future of the Empah

sir Pumpernickle then revealed
how the peanut had proven his salvation when captured by a group
of man-eating Ubangis in the Punjab. “At that time,” he pointed out,

® BOUQUETS to Saint John—you
must be a proud city to claim as
your own, our victim for this week
__Nancy Wilson. Born in the
above city not so long ago—1927
to be precise — Nancy attended
school there until half way through
grade 10—when she left Saint
John High for Edgehill. The clean,
pure Nova Scotian air affected her
in such a manner that in a burst
of exurberant enthusiasm, Nancy
won a Dal-Regional Scholarship.
Having by this time heard so much
about the beauties of life in Halifax—she naturally entered Dal that
Fall, and immediately started to
prove her worth.

Classes and Labs and Things

When asked what activities she
had taken part in at Dal—Nancy
modestly answered “Oh! classes
and labs and things.” We did
find out, however, that last year
she was secretary of the Arts and
Science Society and a member of
the ground hockey team. This
year, already, she is treasurer of
the A. & S. Society, manager of
the ground hockey team, and a
member of the Frosh initiation
committee. Besides all this and
other “extra-curricular activities”
Naney managed to find time to
win the G. H. Campbell Scholarship last year.

Further questioning revealed this
little item, a warning to aspiring
horsemen. Nancy once decided she
would like to learn to ride. Told to
“rip with her knees”—the obedient little lass did — and neither
walked nor sat for three days
afterward. Proof of the old saying
that “the best things come in small
packages.” Nancy is bright, ¢heerful and likeable—a real personality

‘**You are just in time for afternoon tea,’ said Chief Boonagoona
in his native Ubangi. ‘We had five
missionaries and a “Life” photographer for luncheon. They were
delicious. Jump in the pot and
we'll give you a try!’

“Now, gentlemen,” Sir Pumpernickle went on “Just as the
Chief was about to stew me alive,
1 produced a peanut from behind
my left ear—or was it my right
ear ?—oh, well, no matter... lI
produced a peanut, and hurled it
into the midst of the screaming
savages. There was a terrific explosion, the natives were blown to
pieces and I made my escape into
the night. You see, what appeared
to be an innocent peanut was in
reality a miniature time-bomb in
disguise.”

During the question period,
lengthy queries were directed at
Pinkeye by Scoffman, Scofiman,
Scoffman and Scoffman, most constructive of which was the following:

“Now, Sir Pumpernickle, what I
want to know is this. Where are
we going and why? How are we

going and wherefor? And if we
don’t go, whither the peanut?”

“T really don’t know and care
less,” replied Pinkeye. “If mankind dies, the peanut will live on.”

Souvenir Auctioned

Before leaving the meeting and
by way of historical
Sir Pumpernickle displayed a glass
ease containing a partly-masticated
peanut which had been enjojyed by
Prime Minister Chapelmound during the Teheran talks. “The Prime

to give me some as a souvenir,” he
mused. “I now offer you this masterpiece for sale

@ IT IS VERY gratifying to see
the great rise in college spirit this
year, especially among the boys at
the professional schools. More
than ever, the Medical, Dental, and
Law students are taking a keen
interest in campus activities and
are thronging to the social affairs
in greater numbers than in previous years.

Because of this, the duties of
watchman this year will be more
important than ever. The first
year boys better forget their social
life and concentrate for their coming Anatomy exam. Dexter can
tell the pharmacists he’s out of
circulation for two weeks.

Incidentally, we have two schools
of thought prevailing in Dentistry
this year: (1) The Family Man
which includes Johnny and (Flossie), Art and (Edie), Gordie and
(Marg), Sid and (Anita), Brendon
and (Dottie); (2) The Beachcombers which include such nefarious
characters as A. V., Vince, Seki,
Taylor, Steeves, Hashie, our Glee
Club Prexie, Zappie, and the newest
and most progressive of them all,
Strassie. Don’t worry readers,
we'll keep a close watch on this lot
for you. What is causing Seki’s
hair to fall out after every weekend? He can’t be staying in his
inner sanctum too much.

@® ENGINEERING stalwarts coyered themselves with gore and
glory in the first interfaculty game
Tuesday. Due to the unethical
shifting of the touch lines by
underhanded law supporters, the
game ended in a scoreless tie.
Speaking of Law, Drafting room
comment showed some resentment
to the Law scribe’s comment about
the “rough, tough, nasty, hard
hitting, beer drinking Engineers”.
Engineers are not nasty.

The old saying that “Us Engineers don’t need no English” has
gone out of date. One Freshman,
for instance sends a letter to
“Helen of Bridgetown” every day.
How faithful!

Note to freshman Cowan: Following the policy of “Engineers
and gentlemen” it is expected that
one should refrain from making
comments in class when one is haying hair removed from one’s leg
during same. If you’ve gotta cuss,
do it quietly, anyway.

Other notes: The second meeting
of the E.C.M. was held in Mech 4
Wednesday . Treatise for the
week was “Forever Amber”, sermon delivered by Blower, who, he
Says, got it second-hand. It seems
that Mike’s Math instructions are
pretty good. At least he showed
up at Shirreff Hall Open House.
From the same affair, congrats
to “Never-eliminate” Stewart who
walked off with the elimination
dance trophy.

What sudden changes are

It ail hap
manes in other branches of athletics? As far as winning the
Intercollegiate Football crown our
chances are decidedly slim. We
have played two league games and

~ lost both, while Acadia and Tech

remain undefeated. Our Tigers
have two games remaining in their
schedule, one against St. F. X. and
one against St. Mary’s; we may
win both but that will still be too
few to warrant the title.

Though ovr Intercollegiate
chances add up to approximately nil, we still are in line for the
City League title. If we win all
our remaining games, and provided that Tech is defeated at
least once, we will tie with that
team for first place. So there
it stands, as a fighting chance.
With several of the team members on the sidelines with injuries, have we the stuff to go
to cop the City Crown as we did
last year?

Juniors Whip Sophs
In Girls’ Hoop Match

® THE SECOND Interclass baskethall game brought the Juniors up
aguinst the Sophs. The latter encountered a well-organized team
which showed excellent shooting
and guarding and fast plays.
Sharp-shooting Irene Robinson
garnered ten of her team’s 21
points while Pat Jones displayed
very good form and accounted for
her team’s two baskets.

Swimming For All

Several practice basketball
games were also held. Volleyball,
badminton, archery and ping pong
took up the rest of the evening
and most of the girls participated
in several of these sports.

All Freshettes and upperclassmen now have the opportunity of
swimming at the Stad pool on Monday and Wednesday afternoons.
All interested are asked to meet at
the Dal Gym at 3.20 p.m. on either
of these days, and if possible get in
touch with Miss Leonard or Norma
Sherman the day before.

 

 

Commerce Kow-tow to

Powerful Meds 19-3.

® IN THE SECOND Interfaculty
yame of the year the powerful
Med machine kept rolling on its
merry way by swamping the Commerce team 19-3.

In the first half Giberson, former Dal and Mount A. senior star,
crossed the line twice for the
Meds. The only points for Commerce were scored by Cooley on a
Penalty kick.

In the second half the Meds
really ran wild. Butch Favietto
ploughed across the line, followed
soon afterwards by Roy and MacDonald. Favietto converted successfully for two of these tries.
The final score 19-3.

Meds: Giberson, MacDonald, Giffen, MacLennan, Roy Grant, Epstein, Kirkpatrick, Favietto, Babcock, Connolly, Saunders, Shears.

BRYCE BURGESS

INJURED

@® LAST SATURDAY the Dalhousie Tigers and N. S. Tech battled to a 3-3 tie at Studley Field.
The game was an expensive one
for the Tigers since Bryce Burgess,
hard tackling three-quarter man
sustained a broken cheek bone and
will be lost to the team for the remainder of the season,

The game was close all the wxy
with Tech putting the pressure on
the Dal backfield in the closing
minutes, forcing the Tigers to
touch the bail behind their own line
on several occasions. The game
was witnessed by a large but lifeless crowd. :
@ IN THE FIRST half the game
was fairly even. Each scrum’s
sloppy backfield work was about
the same, but the Dal backfield was
sloppier than the Tech backfield,
At the five-minute mark Howard
and MacEwan ran the ball for sixty
yards. Tech took the ball and ran
it down the field only to be stopped by Howard. He got the ball
and kicked the ball over fifty yards
down the field.

MacKenzie Scores

At the fifteen minute mark MacKenzie took the ball from the
scrum and ran the ball ten yards before passing to Hart. Captain Hart
passed the ball to Primrose, who
ran down the sideline. Before being
brought down he passed the ball
in to MacKenzie, who carried it
over the line. The convert was
short.

In the last half the Tech team
kept the ball in the Dal end most
of the time. At the ten-minute
mark Art Leahey got a pass-out
from the serum and ran the ball
down the side to score. The Tech
team, with renewed spirit, began
pressing for another try but they
could not g@t across the Dal line.
The Tigers only threatened once in
this half. Zatszman made a long
run to the Tech five-yard line, but
Tech brought the ball back to Dal
territory and as the game ended

Cop Cuthbertson Trophy
nee Mt. A. in Net Play

Take Every Match

@® BEFORE A LARGE CROWD of spectators, and in ideal
playing condition, Dalhousie racqueteers completely swamped
Mt. Allison tennis players Saturday, to bring another cham
pionship to Dalhousie.

The Tiger players copped the Cuth
bertson trophy, presented by Professor Cuthbertson of Mt. A.,
by smashing their way to victory in eleven matches, and lead
ing in three of the remaining four.

The cup was captured by

Mt. A. in 1939, and since then has not been up for competition,
Dal having won it previously for nine successive years.

Bill Moreside and Blair Dunlop
were the stars of the Dalhousie
drive, showing fine form, despite
quite a layoff in. play. Probably
the best match of the afternoon
was Moreside’s match with elongated Stallard, the pick of the
losers. Although Stallard put up
a good fight, his speed could not
stop the speedier and more experienced Dal player.

Thrilling Ladies’ Match

The match that attracted the
most attention was the ladies’
doubles match. Both sides were
Dal players—

In 0-0 Contest

@® ON TUESDAY afternoon the
Engineers and Lawyers battled to
a scoreless draw in a scheduled

Interfaculty football game. Play
was bright in spots with several
broken-field runs and numerous

long punts featured throughout the
piece. Dave Churchill-Smith and
“Dooley” MacIntosh earried the
brunt of the attack for the Lawyers and Bruce Bauld, spearheaded
the Engineers.

MacPherson and Robinson—emerging victors.

The longest match was played
in semi-darkness and had to be
stopped near the end of the third
set, with Creighton and Hart leading.

The Dal tennis enthusiasts are
looking ferward to a challenge
from the Mt. A. players next year,
and it is hoped that the other universities will dust off their racquets and give the intercollegiate
champions a chance to show their
wares and, naturally, retain the
emblematic trophy.
