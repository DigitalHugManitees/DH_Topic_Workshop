At least, without an intelligent
director, all the time, and energy,
and ambition, and talent, and courage in the world will not produce
Shakespeare. Mr. Pigot, however,
is not only a good Shakespearean
director: he is possibly one of the
best, and one could not help expecting at least a commendable
performance. The result was, indeed, not only commendable, but
an overwhelming and brilliant success.

Phinney and Harris Star

Still and all, without a talented
east, even the best director will
fail, and one can hardly over-estimate the tremendous contribution
of Eileen Phinney as Portia, Lou
Collins as Old Gobbo, Bernard
Creighton as Launcelot, and Don
Harris as Shylock. Considering
the initial difficulties in casting—
of having to choose, as always,
from a comparatively limited number of applicants—Mr. Pigot showed the most remarkable and brilliant insight.

The choice of Eileen Phinney as
Portia was superb. Her performance in the court-room scene, dominating the proceedings as she did
by sheer weight of personality and
voice alone, was magnificent. I
think I shall always remember her
one sentence, “Tarry, Jew,” in
which she packed all her deep con
tempt for the Jew and all the triumph of her victory over him.

Harri? presentation of Shylock,
although frankly I had hoped for
a different interpretation. The part
is an enviable one, and I ached at
times to see Harris so deliberately
ignoring his opportunities. So much
was lost by his failure to face Shylock’s enemies with unaverted eye,
quietly, dispassionately, and coldly
defiant.

His interpretation was, instead,
rather negative. I found myself in
the peculiar position of both hating
the man and pitying him. That
may have been intentional, and I
think perhaps it was. If so, Harris deserves the highest praise.
His performance on the whole—
and especially in the court-room
scene—was magnificent.

The happiest and most successful
job in casting, however, was in the
ehoice of Lou Collins as Old Gobbo,
and Bernie Creighton as Launcelot. Although it was a little difficult to imagine a man as old as
Old Gobbo having a son as Young
Gobbo, for sheer comic-relief (and
that, after all, is a traditional part
of Shakespeare) I have never seen
anything done so admirably.

Triumph on Commerce

In Interfac Debating

Win Beer Parlor Dispute

® SHOULD HALIFAX have beer
parlors? If the answer may be
given according to the debate held
Tuesday night in the Common
Room, the answer is yes. The winners of the debate were the Arts &
Science representatives, defending
the affirmative to the judgment of
Professor Mercer.

The first speaker ‘for the affirmative, Harry Rhude, argued that
with beer parlors we would have
better standards of drinking. He
said that the ability to drink
properly is very hard to achieve
and we should learn the proper
way in moderation.

Al Baccardax argued from the
moral standpoint. His chief point
was the corruption of youth and
the misleading of our younger set.

The second affirmative speaker,
J. Harris, argued on the phase of
industrial employment and_ city
pride. He compared Montreal to
Halifax from the visitor’s point of
view.

Berney Creighton for the negative used government control and
restriction for his argument. He
held that beer* parlors in Halifax
could not have these principles but
would become private enterprise
with profit motives.

Hal Thompson argued for the
necd of revision in our methods of
drinking and the social solutions to
this problem caused by the introduction of beer parlors.

Bill Menchions for the negative used temptation of youth as
his debate. He stated that beer
parlors would only add to this
temptation.

Professor Mercer, in his criticism
of the debate, said the presentations were very good; he made a
number of comments to help the
debaters in future work,

Pine Hill, Shirreff
Hall Students Protest

Government Action

© AT A MASS MEETING last
week, the students of Pine Hill
Residence decided to send a protest
to the Government concerning one
clause of Bill 15 of the National
Emergency Powers Act. The subject was introduced by Earl Leard,
the Pope, who explained that this
bill was to replace the War Measures Act, and to renew the Government’s absolute power to act
through order-in-council. The
clause to which objection was made
was in Section (1), Clause (g),
which would give the Governor-incouncil power over “entry into
Canada, exclusion and deportation,
and revocation of nationality.”
The revocation of nationality has
hitherto been impossible, and it
was felt that this power should not
be given to the Governor-in-Council
since it might be used immediately
to take away the citizenship of
Canadians of Japanese origin whom
the Government wishes to deport,
and might be used later against
other groups. Said veteran:
“That’s against all that we’ve been
fighting for!” The students
pressed themselves as being opposed to racial discrimination in any
form. It was decided to wire protests to all members in the Federal
house from Nova Scotia and Prince
Edward Island. as well as to House
Leaders. A committee appointed, consisting of Al Blakeney,
Cliff Stewart, and Blair Colborne,
to look after the details. In addition, students from Cape Breton
South, and Pictou counties, wired
their own members privately.

A group at Shirreff Hall sent
protests to the House Leaders as

“WE HAVE THE SPIRIT”

@® AS CHAIRMAN of the committee chosen to revive college
spirit at Dalhousie, I would like to
congratulate the student body and
the members of the faculty for the
splendid support given the football
teams last Saturday. That performance proved that we have the
spirit, and all it needs is a little
prodding.

One of the most ardent supporters is the President, Dr. Kerr, who
has not missed one football game
this year. We should all look to
him as an example, and if everyone is as keen as he, Dalhousie
spirit will be kept very much alive.

In an effort to boost college spirit
even higher, I would suggest that
each society holding a dance this
year devote fifteen minutes of its
dance to Dal yells and songs. This
way, more than any other, will do
most to promote a rousing spirit at
Dalhousie.

We have organized ‘a group of
three cheer leaders and plan to add
two pretty co-eds to this group for
the forthcoming basketball and
hockey seasons. In addition to this,
the Dalhousie band will be present
at all future intercollegiate games.

In days gone by, Dalhousie was

‘noted for its fighting spirit and

her championship teams, of which
she had many. This year, with
prospects for excellent basketball
and hockey teams, we can bring
back those days of glory if we all
get behind these teams and cheer
them to victory.

Saturday’s victory over Acadia
was the spark that should start the
toreh burning. Let us all show
that we are proud of Dalhousie by
giving our teams our utmost support. We can do it, Dalhousians!
Let’s do it this year!

School Spirit Threatening
To Become Vandalism?

in answer to the charge that

“and when does it become vandalism?” Here is the answer,
Limit Must Be Set
From east to west university
students agree that limits must be
set to manifestations of school
spirit. Student demonstrations of
college loyalty, no mater how enthusiastic, must not extend to the
destruction of property. Whén this

happens, all reports agree that
school spirit is no longer school
spirit but has become vandalism,

Everyone has a good word to say
for school spirit as such: it is an
indispensible part of college life.
The University of Montreal says,
“30 base on which student
activities are built.”

“School spirit,” says the University of Manitoba, “should go just
so far and no farther. When demonstrations cause damage to property, and annoyance to bystanders
they should cease, because while
still school spirit it becomes a reflection on the school. There is a
time and place for everything.
Students have every right to pride
in the institution they attend, but
fences pulled down and a defenceless public kept from sleep, there
school spirit should stop.”

demonstration of our defiance.

There is no genuine hard feeling
or thought of vandalism or violence. As a matter of fact we like
our enemy.”

“Vandalism may be a mistaken
idea of spirit and excuse for
rowdiness,” according to Queen’s
Uriversity, “and has no connection
with true school spirit.”

an

Student opinion agrees with the
view that vandalism is usually the
work of an irresponsible few who
have spirit. As
McGill University observes, “vandalism is a love of destruction for

no weal school

destruction’s sake, in it there is
no thought of school, spirit of

Truly, it is easy to find flaws—
even in the best productions. But
honest eriticism, after all, determines what is good in a production,
and why it is good—overlooking,
and even excusing, if possible,
what lies at fault. I should like
to say that last Friday night’s .performance of “The Merchant of
Venice” has been of the most immense personal pleasure to review.

THE FOURTH meeting of the
Citizens’ Forum was
at the Murray Homestead on

The

two questions to

attention were,

youngsters just out of school
would you prefer those with a
good general education, or those

with a practical training only; and
second, at what age should children

It was the unanimous opinion of
the Forum that the person with a

trained to do the work, and would

One suggestion of great interest
was that the Federal Government
should control all public school edu

curriculum and the methods of
teaching, thus enabling students
who move from one province to an‘ther to suffer less disruption in
their education. .We must bear in
mind, however, the fact that the

much against such centralization

It was the opinion of all that
compulsory education should continue until the age of 18 and that
after that age part-time schooling
“would be enforced.

Mind In Turmoil

Yes, Balderdash could race
through the most complicated
French classics with ease and
knew his grammar book back
wards, frontwards and sideways,
But, alas, poor lad, he could not
express himself orally in French.
His mind was a wild turmoil of
disconnected facts, dates, and rules.

At the end of his Freshman year
he managed one day to give out
with a “oui” and “non”. Four
years later he had progressed to
“oui, oui” and “non, non’, Needless. to say, the professor was impressed.

But why was Tadpole imprison
ed? Because, on his very first day
in Paris, a waiter asked him:
“Que voulez vous manger, mon
sieur?”” Tadpole swallowed hard,
perspired profusely, wriggled frantically and gulped: “La tante de
Pierre.”

Manger la tante de Pierre? A
cannibal in Paris? The gendarmes
arrived and poor Balderdash was
whisked away.

“Phrases Utiles”

But why “la tante de Pierre”?
Because it was the most prominent
expression in Tadpole’s list of
“phrases utiles’, Such was the
stifled tone of his French classes
back home in Canada.

Although the main aim in teaching French should be to give the
student on eventual speaking
knowledge of same,, should be to
concentrate on “every-day usage’,
on the ear and mouth rather than
pen and paper technique—Tadpole
belonged to the official “Tante de
Pierre’ school of instruction. He
was chained to the nonsensical, archaic expressions of the language
grammarian,

Even though such sentences as
“My grandmother’s sister my
father-in-law’s god-child’s second

is

cousin,” may not be genetically
possible, they are grammatically
sound. So say the pedagogues.

“Give some of it to her for him”
is an old favorite—as is “the garbage-man’s tooth-brush pink,
but the pruning-fork of my greatuncle’s hired man is red,”

is

“Tante De Pierre” Methods

Fact that the student cannot
say “bonjour”, “bonsoir” and “‘comment-ca va?” dosen’t matter, as
long as he can translate the imperfect subjunctive in his sleep
and know umpteen exceptions to
umpteen rules.

It’s also vital to know that
‘“rotule” is the word for knee-cap
and that Voltaire had three and
one-half cups of coffee before he
expired,

Yes, poor Z. Balderdash Tadpole
had been taught by the “Tante de
Pierre’ methods. And look at him
now!

MeGosh gratified to learn,
however, that another Canadian in
Paris (also a victim of the “tante
de Pierre” system) has escaped
the ironic fate of poor Balderdash.
Possessing a larger stock of standard “phrases utiles”, he was better equipped for the fray.

When asked: “Que voulez-vous
manger, monsieur?” .. . he swallowed hard, perspired profusely,
wriggled frantically and gulped:
“La plume du jardinier.”

Which is a step in the right direetion.

we might also add congratulations
to Mr. Price, on behalf of the whole

No wonder the man shakes with

Many of the Law students are
beginning to -wonder what will
happen in the Library before the
exams. It is bad enough now, but
something should be done about it
immediately, before it is too late.
Why should a few students take
out books for days, and sometimes
over a week, before returning
them? They benefit by the act, but
what about the other seventy students? Surely when cases are
being briefed by a number of students in the Library, they can be
kept in better circulation . . .

~ @ AT LAST the rugger team came through. To some it was

a big surprise—to others a pleasant reassurance that the team
did have the goods although the season record might not

show it.

*

The same players that have been used all season
were out there, but certainly not the same team. Mingled with
the capabilities of fifteen individuals there was that element

of ‘fight’ that has been so sadly lacking all season.

How did this come about? some
may ask. We will venture to say
that strong spirit of the thousandedd Dalhousians which pervaded
the stands was the reason. They
made a big noise—they kept the
players conscious that it mattered
to a lot of people that they win
the game—they were the irrepressible driving foree that pushed the
team toward the favoured Acadians’ goal line time and again.
That’s what support—real support,
will do for a team. That was
proven last Saturday.

BASKETBALL UNDERWAY

Basketball has started to roll.
Already the Intermediate Cubs
have two games under their belts.
Keith Matthews, erstwhile U.B.C.
hoopster and now Sports writer
par excellence with the Halifax
Chronicle, is holding the reins in
the capacity of coach and he has
shown that he really knows what
the game is all about. He is enthusiastically satisfied with his
hoop prospects and predicts a suc
cessful season both for his Seniors
and Intermediates in their respec
tive leagues.. The next game is
scheduled for Wednesday night at
the huge Stadacona gym against

plans and prospects of the Swimming Team. He says there has
been quite a turnout to the practices and the team wil shape up
better than last year’s natators.
The loss of Ral Feanny will leave
a hard spot to fill in the breaststroke event, but King voices confidence in Jamie McLeod, prominent
Halifax swimmer, who is said to be
even faster than the redoubtable
Feanny. Bill Powers fills the bill
on the diving board and is rounding
into shape satisfactorily. There ts
a possibility that there will be a
meet with Stadacona towards the
end of this month and King announces that Dalhousie will more
than hold their own against the
well-conditioned navy-men,

two baskets bringing Dal quite
close, but this was erased by the

Two Tie Fixtures

@® A LARGE CROWD witnessed
the first Dal—-Acadia ground hockey
match ever played on Studley Field
on Noy, 3rd. It was one of the
fastest games the Dal team has
played in many a year. The two
teams were so evenly matched that
the play was chiefly between the
twenty-five yard lines, without a
single shot on goal, resulting in no
score for either team.
Journey to Acadia

Last Saturday Dal journeyéd to
Acadia by ear (thanks to Jeannie
Doane and Pat Jones). Another
hot and heavy game took place
with both teams driving to score,
But once again these two teams
ended up with a tie 8-3. The Dal

With 22-16 Win Over “Y”

® DALHOUSIE Cubs greeted the basketball season with a
victory on Monday night, when they defeated last year’s
senior champs, Y.M.C.A., 22-16 in the initial Intermediate fixture on the spacious Stadacona floor.

The game

ras slow, both’ teams showing poor condition.

The new Dalhousie basketball coach, Keith Matthews, had
never seen any of his team before the game, and the team was

rather a pick-up one.

The “Y”’

hoopsters turned up with only

six players and the thirteen Dal players were alternated in

order to tire their opponents.
Play Slow
The first half started very slowly

with poor play on both sides. The
checking was good as the low
score at half time will show.

Frank Rogers scored the first point
on a free shot, to which the “Y”
answered with two baskets by
Price. At half-time Y.M.C.A. held
the edge, 6-5. *%

Under the careful guidance of
Matthews the Tiger quintet worked
the ball carefully in the second
frame. On baskets by Giffin and
Mitchell they started on the march
upwards, but the struggling “Y”
team took advantage of openings
and Dalhousie fouls, to tie up the
game. However, they were not
able to stand the strain and in the
last few minutes the Bengals had
control of the ball to carry away
the game, 22-16,

Rogers, Giffin, Star

Strangely enough, the two high
scorers for the evening belonged
to the losers, Price and Jones, having seven and six points respectively. Frank Rogers and Carl
Giffin each had five for Dal, while
Robinson was another outstanding
player. The Tigers had thirteen
fouls called against them, while the
“vy” had only three.

Lineup: Dal—James, MacKay,
