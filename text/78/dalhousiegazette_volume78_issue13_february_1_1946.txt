We urge that the government

Prominent Dalhousians Pass Away Suddenly

 

DEATHS MOURNED: Professor Walter P. Copp (left), head of the
Department of Engineering, and Dr. James Stewart Martell, assistant
provincial archivist, both of whom died suddenly yesterday morning.

University Mourns Loss of

Three Distinguished Sons

DALHOUSIANS everywhere this
week mourned the loss of three of
the University’s most distinguished sons. Professor Walter P. Copp,
head of the department of Engineering, passed away suddenly
at his home early yesterday morning. Dr. James Stewart Martell,
assistant provincial archivist, also
died Thursday morning after a
brief illness, while the death of
Major John 8S. Roper, long a member of the University Board of
Governors, occurred last Monday
evening at Camp Hill Hospital.

Severe Loss to University

Well beloved and respected by
all his students, Professor Copp
skippered the Engineering department for over twenty-five years,
this service being honoured last
fall with a presentation from his
fellow faculty members. Graduating from Acadia University with
a B.A. and later from McGill with
a B.Se in civil engineering, Professor Copp first served as chief
inspector of the Quebec bridge and
later as assistant designing enengineer in the office of consulting
engineers for the Dominion Government before coming to Dalhousie in 1920. A member of the
Engineering Institute of Canada,
and of the Association of Professional Engineers of Nova Scotia,
he served in an executive capacity
on both organizations. Professor
Copp met his classes as usual on
Wednesday, and his death the following morning came as a severe
Shock to the whole University.
His loss to the Engineering
School, especially at this crucial
time, is inestimable.

He is survivéd by his widow,
Mrs. W. P. Copp, his son, Walter
Ronald of Toronto, and his sister
Eleanor, Mrs. S. G. Waterhouse,
Montreal. Funeral services will be

Hendry’s Appeal Lost
In Lively Moot Court
Case; Nicholson Fined

® WITH inspiring antics by several
of the younger members of the law
school, including the disgraceful
conduct of Dimedaughter, who
buzzed a spitball at the judges,
Moot Court of Dalhousie held its
next to last case on Friday, with
Hatfield the successful respondent
while Hendry’s appeal was lost.
Sitting in sealskins and rubber
boots was Sheffman, Lord Chief
Justice, assisted by Martin and
MacKay as Lords Justice.

The appeal to the Moot Court
of Dalhousie was from the Supreme Court of Australia, which
had also turned thumbs down on
the appellant, a rather abused individual, who had built a race
track and then seen his financial
dreams burst like a bubble when
the respondent built a tower, overlooking the race track, and broadeast the results of the races, in a
well modulated voice and so enjoyably that everybody stayed
home. An injunction was sought
but not got.

Assisting Hendry were Phil
Walker, Dunsmore, and Eaton;
aiding Hatfield were Eileen MacLean, Price, Lovelace, ChurchillSmith. The last named’s speech
was quite discreditable, morsened
by the pair of bedroom slippers he
insisted on paddling around in.
For this C-S was well fined, as
was Don Warner, and Dimedaughter took the rap for his spitballing to the tune of .68c, not
having enough spit left at the end
to even baw] with.

Glee Club Stages 1-Act

Plays--Concert Recital
In Week-end Programme

By MORTON NORMAN

1-Act Plays Vie
For Connolly Shield

@® THE PROGRAM I HAD last
Friday night called it “The Dalhousie University Connolly Shield
One Act Play Competition.” I
have only one argument with that
part of the program, and that
is with the word Competition.
Frankly, there wasn’t much of it.
There were only two plays, both by
Philip Johnson: “World Without
Men”, presented by Delta Gamma;
and “Heaven on Earth’, presented
by Arts and Science.

My only other criticism, with the
program, was that in neither case
were we told what to expect, with
the result that one could expect
almost anything. That was unfortunate. In a one-act play every
moment counts, and it doesn’t do to
spend the first five minutes wondering what it’s all about. “World
Without Men”, I decided, would be
a comedy, since a world without
men would be rather funny. But
“Heaven on Earth”, I thought,
would have some sort of message
to impart. That was a big mistake.
“Heaven on Earth” turned out to be
a comedy too. The fact that everyone laughed at the wrong places,
and at the wrong things, didn’t
matter very much. It was a
comedy, even though the laughs
were misplaced.

Heaven On Earth

However, at the beginning, when
Barbara White, as Jill, confessed
she had been reading poetry in her
bedroom—all about “‘the bees, and
the birds, and the flowers”—I made
some sort of mental note: “Repressed libido: a very psychological
play.” Three or four minutes later
I realized suddenly, with some degree of shock, that Miss White was
supposed to be a young adolescent
(in mind anyway) and that the
play itself, intellectually, was not
much more profound.

Jill, for instance, said all sorts of
shocking things—marriage was just
an outmoded convention, and to
prove it, she and Adrian (her
“mate”) were going to live “close to
nature”, “just like the beasts of the
fields”.

Fortunately she had an intelligent mother, who had long since
passed the stage of being shocked
at anything her daughter said. In

Surprising Talent
Revealed in Concert

@® LAST MONDAY evening, in the
ballroom of the Nova Scotia Hotel,
the Dalhousie Glee and Dramatic
Society presented one of the most
successful public concerts of the
year, and possibly one of the most
brilliant and original recitals ever
staged by the Society. The program featured violin, organ, and
piano solos, as well as choral selections and group numbers,
ranged in theme from Liszt’s brilliant “Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2”,
to such popular and familiar numbers as “The Rosary” by Ethelbert
Nevin. In short, the concert was a
sort of testimonial to what members of the Glee Club have stubbornly maintained: that there is an
amazing wealth of musical talent
at Dalhousie. A great deal of
credit is due to the Society executive for the manner in which that
talent was presented last Monday
night; and recognition made of the
ambition and energy of Mr. Padmore and Mr. White, without whose
efforts the concert would not have
been possible. But the great success of the evening, I think, is due
largely to the individual efforts of
five outstanding soloists—Neil Van
Allen, Geoffrey Payzant, Lorna
Roome, Mary Lou Christie, and
Theresa Monaghan.

Chorus Unsatisfactory.

The program, which opened with
an introductory address by Bileen
Phinney, and the playing of Bach’s
“Toecato and Fugue” for organ, by
David Archibald, was followed by
the chorus, which rendered a group
of popular and semi-classical num

Dalhousie to be Asked
To Participate in Series

® THE GAZETTE learned yesterday from the McGILL DAILY that
Dalhousie has not yet been asked
to participate in this series, but
that the offer is forthcoming
shortly. When queried on Dalhousie’s plans, neither the Council
executive nor the local CBC officials would make any statement,
having so far achieved no communication from Montreal concerning the proposed broadcasts.

a ee ee ee
Montreal, Jan, 25—(C.U.P.)—

Following a Christmas broadcast
made by McGill students for the
International service of the CBC,
plans were announced by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation to
produce a series of student broadcasts which will originate from the
major Canadian campi for Carribbean and South American listeners.

Roy Sampath, former McGill student has been appointed producer

 

of these broadcasts, the next four
of which will originate from
McGill, Toronto, Dalhousie, and
Manitoba Universities,

The Christmas broadcast, a thirty
minute edition of the Canadian
“Spotlight”, was the initial attempt
at such a series. The CBC thought
that the program was sufficiently
successful to warrant a much more
elaborate schedule for the interchange of intellectual and cultural
activity between the Caribbean,
South American, and Canada. Consequently, special periods have been
reserved for airing programs which
will fulfill this aim. “Canadian
Spotlight” student edition No. 2
will originate from Toronto, and
will consist of interrogation and
impressions, messages and music.

Subsequent editions of “Canadian
Spotlight” and “Caribbean Forum”
will take place in the campi of
Dalhousie, Manitoba and Toronto.

ance that is always moving, and
frequently even brilliant.

Unquestionably the most  outstanding performance of the evening, however, was that of Neil
Van Allen, who played Chopin’s
“Scherzo No. 2 in B Flat’, and
Liszt’s “Hungarian Rhapsody No.
2”. The exquisite brilliance of his
tone, and the clear-cut, sparkling
precision of his technique, are both,
obviously, the result of much practice. .But it requires the intelligence and imagination of a great
artist to render the difficult passages of Liszt and Chopin with such
energetic fire, and fervent, rhythmical brillanece. Undoubtedly a gifted
player, Mr. Van Allen has an amazing — possibly even great — career
ahead of him. Such talent is indeed
very rare.

I was rather disappointed in the
performance of the orchestra this
time, which seemed to lack balance
and co-ordination. But the material
is there, I think, and Frank Padmore deserves enormous credit for
recognizing it. On the whole, it is
a worthwhile venture, and deserves
the encouragement and support of
the whole University. That, and a

was sound psychology, and very

Delta Gamma Play

The second play of the evening,
“World Without Men”, was undoubtedly better handled. The story
itself concerned. a mad woman
scientist, who, upon the flick of a
switch, discovéred she could rid the
world of all men, and solve the
world of all its trouble. For the
great event she had invited a
poetess, a female member of Parliament, a woman reporter, and a
prominent socialite to be present.
When they were all assembled, she
pulled the switch, and the stage was
plunged into darkness. When the
lights came on again, all men had
vanished, except one who had
miraculously escaped. As it turned
out, the whole thing was nothing
but a bad dream—which saved the
author a great deal of trouble, of
course, but made everyone feel rather silly afterwards.

Nevertheless, the play was admirably performed. The direction
was excellent, and it was obvious

Shows Students Pall
Distinctive Can. Flag

Kingston. — The great majority
of Canadian university students
feel Canada should have a distinctive flag, but want it to inelude
the Union Jack.

This was shown in the first survey taken by the newly-organized Canadian University Press
Institute of Student Opinion. The
results, however, are not all-inclusive, since 11 of CUP’s 18 members failed to report.

Students at the seven universities which participated were asked the following question, with
results as indicated:

“Do you favor a distinctive flag
for Canada?”

Well Known to Students

Assistant to Dr. Harvey at the
N. S. Archives for the last ten
years, Dr. Martell was well known
on the campus, both personally and
by reputation. Born in Windsor,
N. S., he first attended King’s
Collegiate School and later King’s
College, graduating in 1983 with
a B.A., high honours in political
science and history. Taking an
M.A. in history at Dalhousie, Dr.
Martell was recognized as one of
the University’s most outstanding
scholars when he was awarded
the I.0.D.E. overseas scholarship.
Proceeding to London University,
he obtained his doctor’s degree
and returned to Halifax in 1935 to
join the staff of the Archives,
where he gave promise of a brilliant career. He is survived by
his wife and two small children.
a nS SERESSESNSENSEISERNEINESSSY
from the first that the play had been
carefully chosen, and thoroughly
rehearsed. But much of the credit
for the play’s success is obviously
due to the cast, which was extremely well chosen. In fact, I
should imagine it would be hard to
find another play more admirably
suited to the varied talents of Miss
Weatherby, Miss Godfrey, and Miss
Ross. One would expect Miss Ross
to dominate everything, of course,
and as Mrs. Smith, Member of
Parliament, she had plenty of opportunities. Likewise, one would
expect Miss Godfrey to be one of
the last to arrive, and one of the
first to leave—which she was. In

fact, as Mrs. Robinson, the promi
nent socialite, she had a part that
was almost a Schiaparelli fit. Of
the whole cast she was the only one
guilty of deliberate scene stealing
—but no one seemed to mind a bit.
It was only petty larceny anyway.

The only really disappointing
performance of the play was that
of Thora Reid, as Madame Pavel,
the mad scientist. The truth is, she
was not quite mad enough. She
was extremely nervous, I think, and
I can sympathize with anyone in
that position. But it resulted in a
forced delivery — an almost rigid
monotone—which after awhile became rather tiresome.

Although it was obvious that
Delta Gamma more or less walked
away with the evening, the cast
and director of the Arts and Science
play deserve a great deal of credit
—if only for trying. It was disappointing to discover that of five
plays originally scheduled, only two
were actually staged. Of those
two, the Delta Gamma production
“World Without Men”, was better
handled, but Arts and Science lost
nothing in the venture, and probably gained a great deal in experience. It was an honest attempt,
and they deserve much credit.

MED and LAW

® The University is once again
assuming an air of normalcy, following the campus-shaking events
which were incorporated in the recent late-lamented festivity yclept
“Co-ed. Week.” Once again — to
continue in the theme which pervaded the Co-ed Issue of the
Gazette—once again, may maledom
at Dalhousie rest at ease, with the
assurance that he will not be pursued, wined, dined and danced, by
his eager colleagues of the other
sex. Yes, by all means let Co-ed
Week become an annual institution
at Dalhousie, the learned gentleman
of the Law notwithstanding.

We noted with considerable
amusement the opinion expressed
by one “Ima Cat” on the matter of
Med subtlety. Our comment: (1)
We trust that the naiveity which
underlies the literary contribution
referred to is not representative of
the Co-ed mind at large. (2) The
nom-de-plume was highly appropriate.

All Meds will be pleased to learn
that both Banquet and Ball were
successful financially, and, to the
best of our knowledge, more than
fulfilled all expectations socially. It
was particularly encouraging to
note that the banquet idea got off
to a good start. Let’s hope that it
will become an annual institution.
Incidentally, future banquet committees will note that the date can
be set without regard to Co-ed
Week; for it is only in the case of
the Ball that the virtue of subtlety
is to be invoked. Seriously, our
congratulations to President Titus
upon his choice of speaker for the
oceasion. Brickbats to students of
fourth year, whose attendance was
particularly disappointing by comparison with the excellent response
noted in the pre-clinical years. Art
T. might suggest to his successor
the wisdom of ascertaining the
marital status of the guest speaker!

alas! Many of us didn’t hear her—

in force, and by their very presence
definitely contributed to the success of the evening. And here’s

British Colonial Mission
Conducting “Anti-Vice”’

Crusade Through Empah_

by J. CRICKET McGOSH

® “I DO WANT TO congratulate you Canadians.
rahly put up a jolly good show. You’ve come of age. You’re
a great acquisition to the Empah.”
former Labor M.P. and chairm

You’ve

So spake Lady Asta,

an of the British Colonial Mis
sion, when interviewed by McGosh on her arrival here recently.
Other members of The Mission included the Rt. Hon. Sir Perry
winkle Middlebury-Tidbit, C.M.G., B.T.,

former Lord High

Commissioner of His Majesty’s Stationary Supplies, and the
Rt. Rev. Chauncey Crumpet-Muffin, Missionary-in-Chief to the
Colonies. Lord Asta also came along to tend to his wife’s four

pekinese puppies.

The delegation is currently touring the

colonies conducting “ a rigorous campaign against the delinquency and loose-living which is splitting the Empah asundah.”

Tea and Crumpet Approach

Lady Asta explained that the
Empah would have to get away
from the aleohol-and-nicotine concept of life and concentrate on the
tea-and-crumpet approach. This
would take a good deal of effort,
she said, “but we can jolly well do
it if we put owah shouldahs to the
wheel.”

“Most progressive spot in the
Empah,” remarked Mr. CrumpetMuffin, “is the Lowe¥ Zambesi Valley of the Punjab. The natives
there don’t know the meaning of
alcohol and cigarettes and other
horrid practices—and they’re a jolly
sight happiah for it.”

“But I always thought the Zambesi natives were head-hunters and
cannibals,” piped MeGosh.

“Quite true, old chap. But what
could be a healthier sport? They
also go in for soccah and cricket,
which is jolly good character training. By the bye, I suppose you
haven’t heard the results of the Nottingham-Shropshire test-match. I
do hope Buttersgill wasn’t out for
a duck. Braithwaite-Mullsley’s got
a beastly off-break spin on the wicket.”

Lady Asta stated she would go
on record in support of the Halifax
Citizens’ Committee to Oppose Beer
Parlours. . . . “Pity your splendid
town—unspoiled to date by sin and
corruption—should have its record
tainted by the evils of strong
drink.”

* * ~”

Replying to McGosh’s query as
to the prevalence of beer pubs in
the Mater Country, Her Ladyship
explained that the acquisition of
dart games and checker boards had
“mercifully reduced the per capita
consumption,”

Empah Solidarity

“But you colonials aren’t used to
that sort of thing,” said Sir Perrywinkle, “and we’re going to make
jolly certain you don’t get a
chawnce.”

Rt. Rev. Crumpet-Muffin then
deplored what he called “ the savage use of bubble gum and other
uncouth stimulants which, besides
wearing down the jaw muscles, are
hardly acceptable in polite circles.”

“Yes,” chimed Middlebury-Tidhit, “the force of our campaign
will be felt from the Fiji Islands
to Indjah—from the humblest native pottering about with his witchcraft and all that sort of thing, to
the most prosperous land-owner in
the Mater country. We are crusading for a return to the simplest impulses with which Mater Nature

endowed us. It is not too caddishly impossible to foresee the day
when alcohol will be replaced by
goat’s milk, nicotine by wild-cherry
bark, and bubble-gum by licorice,
humbugs and harmless sweets of
that sort.

‘We bounders of the Mission pride
ourselves on belonging to an Empah on which the sun nevah sets.
It is owah fahvant wish that the
sun may rise each morn over an
Empah totally devoid of the hangovers and nicotine with which it is
now so devilishly afflicted.”

The “Mission” has a more flexible
social agenda. After attending successive showings of “Kitty” and
“Madonna of the Seven Moons”.
they plan to “renew acquaintances
with Navy ward-rooms in the
area.”

To round out their program, they
will “sit in” on the Dalhousie Boilermakers’ Ball to get “a first-hand
impression of Canadjun youth, upon whose high moral calibah depends the integrity of the Empah

and the world.”
eee

The conductor halted the lovely
young mother, and warned: “You'll
have to pay full fare for the boy,
He’s wearing-long pants.”

The mother snapped, “All right
but you'll have to let me ride free.”

it HIGHLY RATED

_ XAVIERIANS TONITE

® DAL TIGERS will be looking for their second straight victory at the Arena tonight at 8 o’clock, when they play host to
St. F. X. in a regular fixture of the Maritime Intercollegiate
Hockey League. Dick Currie will lead the Bengals against the
highly-touted Xaverian squad in what promises to be a very

exciting match. Leading the St. F. X. sextet into the fray

will be several members of the Antigonish Bulldogs, recent

 

conquerors of the fast-moving Truro Bearcats.

 

LEADS ...

... HOCKEYISTS

Tars Out-Play Dal
52-30; Tiger Squad
Still In Doldrums

@® DALHOUSIE WAS defeated by
the strong Peregrine quintet Monday night when the sailors coasted
to an easy 52-30 victory. The loss
left the Tigers in the cellar position of the League, but still with
good possibilities of making a playoff berth.

The game was rather listless, the
Tigers giving their worst exhibition
of ball handling to be seen this
season. Led by Gerasinoff, Peregrine took a long lead in the initial
frame, the half ending 35 to 18.
The Bengal rearguard failed to
produce to a sufficient defence, and
each man seemed to be wandering
around the floor. Not only was the
shooting of the Dal forwards exceptionally poor, but they failed to
rush in and take advantage of the
rebounds.

Second Canto More Even

The second canto was more even
in play, the Tigers displaying more
fight, although missing golden opportunities to score time and time
again. Giffin was the only consistent player for the collegians,
while Dunlop and Eddie Rogers led
the offensive with nine points each.

The game was rough, thirty fouls
heing called, twenty-one of them
going to Peregrine,

Dalhousie: Dunlop, 9; E. Rogers,
9; Farquhar, 2; Cooley, 0: Giffin, 6;
Knight, Alee Hart, 2.

 

Included in the visitors’ lineup
are: Shorty MacDougall, their
capable net guardian, who has had
considerable experience in the A.
P. C. league; stocky John McKetyn, hard-hitting Bulldog defenceman; and the fast skating trio
of Toner, Ferguson and Chouinard
who aided the Antigonish team in
their first win over Truro.

The Tigers will encounter with
the high-scoring Churchill-Smith
and Currie combination, ably assisted by the smooth-passing LeBlane-Blakeney-Knickle line. The
Tigers will be strengthened by the
return to the lineup of left-winger
Eddie Crowell and defenceman Zen
Graves, both fully recovered from
their injuries.

The Mills-coached squad is facing
a tough test in this match against
last year’s Intercollegiate Ice
Champions, but Dal colours will be
well represented on the ice.

It is hoped that as much can be
said for Dal rooters at the Arena
tonight. Turnouts to Varsity games
have been very poor so far and it
is about time that Dal students
gave a little vocal support to their
teams.

Lineups for the game are:

St. F. X.: Goals, Shorty MacDougall, Gagnon; defence, McKetyn, Laurie McDonnell; forwards, Pellerin, Campbell, MacIntyre, Toner, Ferguson, Chouinard,
MacKenna, MacGill.

Dalhouse: Goals, McKeough,
Troop; defence, Graves, Clark,
Wade; forwards, Currie, ChurchillSmith, Crowell, Blakeney, Knickle,
Lightfoot.

@ TONIGHT the hockey-minded Tigers stack up against the
St. Francis Xavier lineup in what promises to be the feature
match of the Nova Scotia Intercollegiate Hockey League. The
Xaverians boast a very strong and» experienced sextet
and are favored to take the Maritime title which they
won handily last season.

Most of the Xaverians are first-class performers with the
current Antigonish Bulldogs who have scored several wins
over the high-flying Truro Bearcats and New Glasgow Bombers of the A-P.C. League. Spark-plug ef the Antigonish lads
is defenceman John McKetyn, all-round athlete from Glace
Bay, who comes up from his rearguard spot to do a lot of the
team’s scoring.

But Dalhousie’s representatives are not to be forgotten.
With a flashy goalie, a hard-hitting defence duo in Zen Graves
and Bob Wade and two well-balanced, smooth-passing forward
units, the Tigers present a force to be reckoned with. Coach
Pete Mill has brought his charges through some gruelling
workouts since last “week’s win over Tech and has ironed out
most of the kinks. Dick Currie and Dave Churchill-Smith,
two lads with lots of hockey moxy, are expected to lead the
Bengals to victory. Make it a gala victory with your support.

Basketballers Vs. Mt. A.

Tomorrow night’s exhibition basketball encounter spells
finis to the week-ends’ sporting activities. Winless as yet, the
hoopsters face their first test in Intercollegiate circles and will
be out there to show their very best to win from the powerful
Mount Allison squad. The Mount A. cagers are on a basketeering tour of the province and have already played
Acadia and Tech and should be in tip-top shape for the big

game tomorrow night.

On the boxing front, things are going along great guns.
Last week, the new coach, Lefty Jordan, put in his first appearance and after talking to a few of the would- be boxers,
we find that he really turned on the heat and put the chaps
through their paces.

King’s Quintet in Hard-Fought Joust

 

 

 

® IN A HARD-FOUGHT BATTLE that featured two great
rivals, the Dal Cubs successfully rode to a 35-24 victory at the
expense of the King’s quintet. King’s, fresh from victories
over Mt. A. and Stad, brought out pr -actically their whole college as a cheering section, showing Dal what college spirit
really is.

Smith Runs Wild

The confident Kings quintet
opened the first half in great
style, capturing a handy lead of 6
points, leading 13-7 at quarter
time. But the do-or-die Bengals,
not to be overcome by the enthuastic Kings supporters, soon whittled down the lead. Paced by
starry Adam Smith, the Tigers
clustered their opponents, Howard

 

being the only Kings player to successfully put up a fight. Many
times Howard nipped the ball away
from the Cub dribblers before they
could start an attack. The first
half ended 19-17 in Dal’s favour,

Cubs Increase Pace

The Cubs increased the pace in
the second period, Smith running
in two quick baskets and Robinson one. The checking was close
but clean, the teams exhibiting
much fight. Kings only registered
7 points in this canto while the
Cubs came through with 1. The
large crowd of Kings supporters
continued their cheering in this
frame, the Dal supporters adding a
round of applause every here and
there.

Delicious with milk as a bedtime snack—

crisp, crunchy graham with healthful bran.

MARVEN’'S <<:

 

Game Cleanly Contested

The game was cleanly contested,
with only 16 fouls being handed
out by referees Cox and Mitchell.
For Dal, Smith and Robinson led
the offensive, while Robinson and
Morrow did a great job in checking
Hannington and Howard, the flashy
Kings forwards. Bill Morrow led
the Kings attack with 11 points.

Lineup:
Dal: A. Smith 14, Creighton 3,
Mitchell, Robinson 8, F. Rogers 2,
Blakeney 2, J. Morrow 4, Algie 2.
Kings: Howard 10, Smith, Henderson, B. Morrow 11, Hannington
