This debate was comparatively well attended, as debates and other educational events
go, doubtless due partly to the present great
popular interest loeally in the subject which
was under discussion.

Win or lose, we are confident that the members of Dalhousie’s' Varsity Debating Team
will worthily unhold the honor of their Alma
Mater against McGill tomorrow. night in
Montreal.

Notes From The Uriversity Library
The valuable. eollection of Canadiana in
the University Library continues to grow

slowly but stead. Mr Wo H. Dennis, one

of the most generous friends of Dalhousie,

when founding the Dennis prizes for prose

_ and poetry, made the provision that in: the
event of there being an unexpected. balance

left of the money set apart for these prizes,

this sum should be devoted to the purchase
of books for the Library; and, thanks to this
kind thought, the Librarian has been enabled
to add a number af new books to the Canadian

After a strenuous campaign conducted by
lieutenants Lavers and Willigar, ‘‘ Andy
Gump’’, the people’s representative, alias
Sandy McDonald, was elected by a large
majority to his seat in next year’s Council of
che Students.

Earl Green, the other Dental representative, won his seat by more subtle means, as
the principal plank in his platform was his
promise to agitate for more leeway for Dentals in the V. G. Arehie and Trainor. who
are both vitally interested in this respect,
supplied the ammunition for his campaign.

Gauvin & Gentzell’s camera has been severely tested by the fourth year, and ‘‘Bert’’
and Dalgleish who so generously waited until
the last are now ready to watch the dickey
bird. Their forbearance in this respect was
much appreciated by the other members of
Class ’24,

Trainor believes in the old adage “Safe
bind safe find,’’ and has shown it by putting
three padlocks on his locker containing the
pilferings of four years.

An interesting exhibit of Dental accessories was given at the Halifax Hotel last week
by the Ash Temple Co. The boys all visited

THAT MOUNT ALLISON TRIP!

Carol, the captain, comes first of all,

With her angelie smile as she passes the

hall,

Angelic, but not angel-like. Oh, Carol,
why did you let him forget to give you the
rabbit’s foot? Perhaps he would have come
along himself if he had known about the
broken-hearted litthe Mount A. boy—if only
to put him out of misery by breaking the
rest of him!

Elinor, the manager, had the responsibility
of the manners, morals and condition of the
team upon her shoulders. It’s hard to get a
team to bed early and to keep them from
eating apple pie for dinner, isn’t it, Elinor?
But Edith says that pie is nice just before

basketball match, especially when you almost sleep through breakfast. By the way,
one of the Mount A. girls, on seeing Edith,
asked, ‘‘Who is that little girl_—your mascot?”’

Margery and Marion, the two marvellous
martial maidens, showed their debating
prowess and class loyalty on the trip up.
Everybody on the train now knows to which
class each belongs and why. But, Marge,
why, oh why, did you go to the Class ’26
party?

Everybody on the train also knows, from
remarks made upon an item in the morning
paper, which members of the Dalhousie Liberal Government have the honour to be looked
upen with favor by the team,—and which
have not that honor.

Rosie liked Mount A. so well that she
stayed at the Ladies’ College for the weekend. Did you do some more exhibition daneing for hens Rosie?

Within the round walls of my heart
A fragrant flower grew;
My happiness was sunshine blessed,
And tender tears the dew,

Within the round walls of my heart
Blew cold winds from outside,

The sun’s rim dipped, dim shadows fell,
And then my flower died.

Within the round walls of my heart
Nought: but destroyer’s trace;

But by a light from way far off,

I saw you in my flower’s place.

Within the round walls of my heart
The sunshine blazed anew;
A flower is but a flower frail,
The light of life is you.

money might be raised for the school Memorial
Fund. The purpose of this fund is to erect «8

un Gaidlaig Dalhousie

With a’ view to the promotion of a deeper

study, of the Celtic language and literature
the’ Dalhousie Gaelic Society has ‘been lately
organized.

President—W. B: MacOdrum.

Vice-President—M. C. MaeDonald, B. A.

Secty.-Treasurer—-John A. Nicholson.

Executive: Rod. MeelIntosh, John I.
Morrison, J. D. N. MacDonald.

The first annual banquet was held at the
Green Lantern on Thursday night last.
Several. of the most prominent men of the
city were among the guests, invluding Mr. D.
MacGillivray, Mr. Justiee (Ciicho’m. several
of the leading elergymen, and other distinguished citizens.

The arenes includes a toast to Scotland
by Mr. M. ©. MaeDonald of Pine Hill and
Rev. J. W. Someta one to the guests by
George M. Morrison of the Dal. Law School
and Mr. J, A. Walker, well-known to Dalhousians as Coach of the debating team;
another to the Gaelie Society by Rev. D.
MacOdrur Sinclair. There were
several Gaelic songs by Mr. John J. MaeKinnon, Mrs. (Dr.) S, J.-MacLennan, and
Mr. Norman MacCalder. The Caledonia
Quartette, ‘‘Red’’ MacLean, M. A. MaceMillan, J. D, N. MacDonald and D. M. Grant,
sang some old, favorites among Scotch people.
There was also the stirring notes of ‘the
pibroch: Pipe-Major Stewart and Mr. A.
MacDonald were encored again and again as
they played Highland airs. —

There were several short speeches. Mr.
Justice Chisholm spoke of the value of
Gaelic Literature. He paid a sincere tribute
to the late Rev. A. MacLean Sinclair, whose
son has been largely responsible for the
success of the new organization.

Mr. D. MacGillivray -followed Mr. Justice

           

Chisholm. He pledged his support as a

governor of Dalhousie to the support of the
Association.
There were several other addresses and the

evening was brought to a close by singing

first ‘‘Oidhche Mhath Leibh’’, (Good Night. )

and then the sixty banqueters clasping hands

around the table and joining in Seotland’s
greatest lyric: ‘‘Auld Lang Syne.’’ — |

Pine Hill Post*

The event of the week - was the ‘‘HL.L. ,?
Club banquet at the Tarry Inn, Friday night.
There was a brief and snappy program of
songs and stories. Toasts were drunk to
Pine Hill, Dalhousie, and the most popular
prof. at Dal. The speakers included N. A.
Patterson, Allan Hill, Curry Creelman,
Sidney Gilchrist and Ches Oake. The Pine
Hill Quartette surpassed their previous
triumphs, while ‘‘Red’’ MacLean and ‘Bun’
Barnaby convulsed the Club with their comic
skits. Each member of the club was responsible for an anecdote and thus some vivid
flashes of past history were revealed. Howeyer the Club is secret so these cannot be retold here. The piano accompaniments were
provided by ‘Bingo’ Harrison. The stellar
performance of the evening was a_ cornet
selection by our Cardinal, Harold Baird. To
W .A. Patterson, the Director, and Harry
Langwith, the President, is due in large
measure the success of the Club, which has
geome to be an important factor in Pine Hill
life,

_ Carl Coffin, that scientist of laboratories,
and test-tubes and ill-smelling chemicals, has
discovered a new compound that will revolutionize the manufacture of cosmetics. The
supreme worth of the Coffin discovery is that
the compound is taken internally. A minute
fraction of Coffinola in the filling of a chocolate guarantees youthful bloom for a year.

Class ’27 Enjoys Last “Fresh” Party.

 

The Freshmen had their last class party
on Monday, March 3. They left the
Forrest Building in three sleighs, and had a
jolly ride to the Wayside Inn and_ back.
After the drive they were entertained at the
home of Miss K. Hagen, a member of the
class, where a delicious supper was served,
and the rest of the evening spent in dancing.

The chaperones were Mrs. Young, Mrs.
Rutherford and Prof. Bell. It is the regret
of all that Mrs. Bell could not be there on
account of sickness.

Unripe Students and Immature

Bernard Shaw, in a letter advising a young university student of radical tendencies to continue
at college and there secure a full academac training, prophesized as follows. +

when there will be a break betw een the school and

university increases in geometrical proportion—
they get twice as much out of their second year as
from the first, and twice as much again from the
third year as from the second—and so on.

The reason for this is not so apparent. here
is ya maturity or rather, a sophistication that passes
for maturity—intellectual maturity—that a university course gives. Then there is a maturity
that age alone gives; a sort of mellowness or ripeness that comes faster with some people than with
others, and which is the ‘result of experience; the
result af a large number of experiences of a varied’
nature, ‘This can be observed in those members
‘of: thé undergraduate body who are slightly older
than the average. It is not that they excel in their
‘studies, but their outlook, their judgements, their
appreciation, are all deeper and more solid. They
‘Rave ‘€'t0 a certain extent, to an extent greater than
the: aiverage student, arrived at a sense of values,
They ean fully
appreciate the university and judge it and what
it teaches. They are not to be spoon fed; they
are adults who value before they accept. Their
intellectual digestive apparatus is completely
‘equipped; it is ready to receive and consider all
manner of problems.

Some people arrive at such a maturity at an
early age. A wealth of experience may make an
intellectual adult out of a boy of fifteen. On the
other hand one who has lived a sheltered life, and
whose experience consists of home, public school
and collegiate, may not reach this stage at twentone. But this much is certain; there is more
chance of intellectual maturity in one of eighteen
or twenty, than in one of sixteen or thereabouts.

The age limit for admission to the university

Dalhousie Co-Eds Defeat Mt. Allison

The Dalhousie co-eds defeated the Mount
Allison ladies’ basketball team at the Dalhousie gymnasium last Saturday afternoon
by a seore of 28 points against their in
ents’ 24,

During the first period the Dal girls adh
18 points while the Mt.. A.“ team_was successful in obtaining 14 points. The sceond period
resulted in an additional 10 points for each
team. Both teams displayed excellent combination. —

Saturday’s game caused a_ three-cornered

tie for the League championship, so it was

decided to award the title to the team with the
most points to its credit, Acadia winning by
a total of 70 points. Dalhou.ic came second
with a total of 69 points and Mount Allison
third with an aggregate of 66 points for the
season.

made is that this causes a break in the educational
system. What is the student to do, who matriculates at sixteen and who cannot enter the university until two years later? Bernard Shaw may
be right, in stipulating that a person should be
self-supporting before he enters college. We do
not intend to enter into a discussion of this view
here. ‘Phis much is certain,.that the student will
derive more from a course of training if he enters
upon it at a more mature age. What he will do
in this hiatus in his education is immaterial. He
will gain the most if he. works with his hands, and
experiences that elation that comes, when one, for
the first time is absolutely self-supporting.

The way to get
the finest shave

The Hinge-Cap is a sure way of identifying
Williams Shaving Cream. And Williams, besides giving you the convenient Hinge -Cap,
will improve your shave in three ways:

First, the lather is heavier and holds the

moisture in against the beard.

Quicker and

more thorough softening of the beard results.
Second, the razor glides more easily through the Williams-softened beard because Williams
lather lubricates the skin, Lastly, an ingredient

in Williams keeps the skin in
‘ _ ho matter how heavy your beard nor how
frequently you shave. In addition, you'll enjoy
Williams because it is a pure, natural white
cream without coloring shatter Of any kind,

ners in the Interfaculty basketball games
played in the gym on Saturday afternoon
March 18th.

The first game was between the Arts and
Medical teams. This game was the best- of
the three, being more closely contested than
the others. The Arts team had won all their
games and as winners of the pre-Xmas league
were looked on to repeat their previous per.
formance in the present series, but the Medieal team upset the dope. The game was very
elosely contested. Richardson and Swan
starred for Arts; Hewat and Chisholm fo»
Medicine. The final score was 14—9 in favor

of Medicine.

The line up :—
Arts—Centre,
Swan (5). Ross,
Intosh, Frame.

Medicine—Centre, Dowell; forwards, Hewat (8), Chisholm (6); guards, Baird, Sutherland ; spares, MacLean, Johnson.

The second game was a one-sided contest
between the fast Law team and the Engineers. The game was featured by high seor
ing on the part of the Law forward line.
Engineers did not furnish enough oppositior
io make the game interesting. Final seore
was 44—8 in favor of Law.

Acadia Co-Eds Win Nova Scotia
Championship.

The fourth match in the Girls’ intereollegiate League was played in the Dalhousie
Gymnasium on Friday evening, Mareh 7,
Acadia winning, 18—1l1. The Aeadia girls
led from the beginning, and, although the
game was not one-sided, the visitors were in
better form than the home team. Miss May
Ward, from the Halifax Ladies’ College,
refereed. ‘This mateh makes the total seore
between Dalhousie and Acadia. 36-30 in favor
of Acadia, leaving the Chase Cup at Wolfville
again this year.

The Acadia team arrived on Friday morning, being met at the station by some of the
Dalhousie team, and escorted to Shirreff Hall,
where they were entertained during their
Visit.

After the match the Acadia teams (men’s
and girls’) and their chaperones, Mr, and Mrs,
Ochorne were entertained at a dance at
Shirreff Hall by the Dalhousie teams, part of
the Pine Hill crchestra providing the music.

[t was unfortunate that each team lost a
forward through accident, Jean MacLaughlin
of the Acadia team having injured her side,
and Rosie Goldstone of the Dalhousie team
ankle, before the match.

The line up:—

Acadia—Forwards, Anne Doherty, Carol
Chipman; guards, Pauline Collbath, Helen
Lawson (capt.); guards, Beatrice Smith, Tae
MacLean; spares, Kathleen King, Mickie Mitehell.

Dalhousie — Forwards, Marion Campbell,
Edith Maeneill; centres, Marjorie Kennedy,
Carol Hawkins (eapt.) ; guards, Elinor Barnstead, Harriet Roberts; spares, Mabel Borden, Alison MeCurdy,

The Dal girls’ basketball team played two
practice matches last week, one on Monday
in the Gymnasium against. the Y. W. C. A.,
and one on Tuesday in the Y. M. C. A.
against the Halifax Academy girls.

Both games were won by Dalhousie, the
first by a score of 26-12, the second by a score
of 19-17.

STILL ANOTHER WIN FOR LAW

_

The Law quintette added another victory to their
already long list by defeating the tast Art team
to the music of 22—8 on Saturday night. The
game was quite fast and as rough as usual—
although clean. Gushue starred for the winners
and scored practically all the points. It would be
hard to choose a star amongst the vanquished.

Medicine, Arts and Law have yet to combat for
the highest honors, and some keen contests are
predicted. ¢

 

-_-_—

Congratulations to the New Glasgow
hockey team on winning the championship of
Nova Scotia, by defeating Kentville 5—1 and,
winning the series 7—6 goals.

This victory speaks well for the Dal
Tigers as they had the steel town boys on the
short end of a 5—8 seore with only a few
minutes to go, but the town boys pegged in
two more to even the count, and the draw
could not be broken,

That spies lurk in the darkest of places;
But one thing more is a truth I find
That imagery takes form in your spaces.

I like to do and contribute my part

And help with mirth—or contention,

For you needs have a keen sense of humor,

A Basketball Win

 

Before a large and keenly interested audience in the Gym, Mareh 7, Dal’s _basketball team won over the Acadia team by a
29—20 score.

The teams played a neck and neck game in
the first half, scoring »basket for basket—
Acadia two points ahead at the end.

The second stage was much faster and the
shooting better. Dal’s combination was excellent. Mader, on this account, being able
to score. 12 points in this half.

For Acadia, Clarke and Brown were the
outstanding players, putting up a great exhibtion, but the former shy on the baskets.
