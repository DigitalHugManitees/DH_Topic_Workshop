Happiness

 

fs happiness a gift for all, or but a chosen few?

Of course tis each man’s sacred right, and yet
it’s very true,

That though we’re given the task to mould our
own, too much ‘s left

To circumstance. We wonder where we're led,
of choice bereft;

And though we’re often gay—have peace
enough, what’s emptier

Than constant gayety? Than too much calm.
What’s drearier?

What then is happiness? An inward stete of
bliss you'll say.

That’s so; but it must have some outward
cause, there is no way

To make escape from things external. Riches,
wisdom. power,

Are fickle dreams, which e’er elude our grasp,
for when the flower

ls picked, it’s beauty fades; we search to find
a fairer yet.

We must have worked we like to do, to which
goal is set

Far different from. mere selfish aims.
must sacrifice

Ourselves for someone else . In service only is
the spice

Of keen and active joy. Thus there is really

- nothing less

Than chosen work for those we love to have

true happiness.

in this
article of special interest to Engineers. For
many ‘years Dr. Monin has held a prom nent
position in one of the largest technical colleges
in America and his statements are deserving

Elsewhere issue is published an

of serious consideration. His article is but
another ind cation that engineering is becoming
more of a profession every day. And the
world demands from a professional man something more than specific service. The engineer
of the future has a social position which he
must be prepared to fill. He must provide
himself with qualifications whth the public
will ask of him.

While we are thus advised to pursue a more
liberalized course, the pressure from all departments for more time is increasing. It
means ultgnately that another year will be
tacked on to our course.

If a liberalized curriculum thus broadens the
mind and improves the personality of the
engineer, it certainly puts him on an _atellectual plane unattained by a great many students of the liberal arts. It would confer on
him a culture which would form a valuable
asset to the professional accompl shments of
more than engineers.

 

Talking about curriculums, here’s one with
whiskers:

Freshette (on the dance floor)—Do you
know, there’s one thing that bothers me, |
can’t adjust my curriculum.

He (blushingly giving her the once over)—
Er-a- you can’t notice it from here.

 

Below are printed some extracts from an
article ‘on “Liberal‘zing Studies in the Curriculum of Engineering Courses” by Louis
Celestin Monin, Ph. D., Dean and Professor of
Economics and Philosophy, Armour Institute of
Technology, Chicago:

“The teaching of engineering subjects frequently leads us to lose sight of the fact that
an engmeering education is, after all, not a
problem of engineering but a problem of edu
cation.. And all education includes — besides —

the training for scholarship—the acquisition of
culture and the development of character.”

“In order to ‘see life steadily and see it
whole.’ the scient'fic type of collegiate education must be impr with the broadenin
and inspiring spirit of literary and philosophical thought. A few untechnical. unprofessional
studies “conta\ning the elements which draw
forth the undeveloped man within” must be
introduced into the engineering curriculum.

“Very frequently the engineer complains of
spiritual isolation. Why are not more engineers
in the public-posit'ons or called upon to guide
civic movements and socal affairs? ‘In many
cases it is because of their narrow attention to
professional work alone.

Speaking. The faculty of the Armour Inst ‘tute
is now convinced that the curriulum thus
arranged does not suffer from the inciusion o1
liberalized studies and that an hour or two per
week less of Calculus or Drawing, etc. (no
stamping. gentlemen, please) and a few more
lectures on the “great ultimate problems which

‘the world puts to the thinking mind of man”

bring better results. —

The engyneering student should, however, begin only as much of the subject as he can safely
hold and digest. He should not let those subjects throw him out of his track or interfere
with his conception of the scientific truths obtained by analysis, by observation and experiment. ‘Their purpose is to stimulate mental
activity lying fallow and to enlarge the vision
of young engineering students. The teacher’s
duty is to show the-student that the most difficult art is the Art of Living. and that man is
truly educated only when he orders his Ife on
principle.

 

On Nov. 22nd eleven of Dalhousie’s budding
Engineers assembled on Hollis Street. and proceeded to the Nova Scotia Tramways’ plan‘
on Water Street, where they first visited the
oe. gas works, under the guidance of
Mr. P. Burke, yard foreman. of the plant. Mr.
Burke explained very clearly and carefully
each step in the generative and refining processes for the manufacture of coal gas, from

‘ Oe unload'ng of the coal from the ships to the

Shirreff Hall

 

‘‘And unextinguished laughter shakes the
skies.’”’ Thus murmured Jehi Remm as the
door leading into the Hall of Laughter opened. The Hall of Laughter is the ground floor
wing, famous for its merriment since the
arrival there of Elizabeth MacGregor
“Laugh and the world laughs with you’’ is
Lib’s motto, and the world, (namely Jane
Graham, Blanche, Kay, Harriet Matheson,
Isabel and Agnes) certainly do laugh with
her ‘‘sans intermission.”

The other evening Isabel’s room presented
a studious scene when suddenly Lib remarked, ‘‘O Isabel, do let’s stop studying, and
let’s sit on the bed and laugh.’’ Isabel was
dubious at first, but she found it could be
done, and was most exhilerating.

The laughing fever is growing, so if anyone feels dull we advise a trip to some spot

near this wing, and we can guarantee that
these ‘‘silver chimes’’ will banish your every

In spite of the fact that the girls of the
Ziegfield Follies are now wearing their hair
long, the Dalhousie girls persist in being
sensible, and the army of the unbobbed
diminishes daily. Sometimes the shorn
lambs do not much resemble their former
selves. The other evening many of the girls
thought Elizabeth Morton’s sister was visit:
ing at the Hall, while others were insulted
to think a stranger was coming to visit them
at such an hour of the night. Some were
able to-look behind the camouflage and recog:
nize their old friend. ‘‘Oh, isn’t it sweet!’’
said Tod Miller. ‘‘How do you know?”’ ask
Twice last week we were disturbed at
dinner by a distant rumbling from a westerly
direction. But we finally located it as coming from Miss Lowe's table and the innocent
cause thereof the respective voices of Mr.
Clark and Mr. Williams.

“Courage sister, do not stumble,
Though thy path be dark as night,
: There’s Irene to guide the humble,

Trust in her, for she’ll go right.’’.

And’ what would we have done without her,
as she bravely pilotted our faltering footsteps
along the eutting tu Pine Hill, to Mr. Will
jams’ lecture? We supposed that, now Lab-.

The opportunity of a life time was not to
be sneczed at, and-Herbie took full advantage
of everything. Sitting in the middle of the
roof. it looked as if he were saying :—

‘‘Come one, come all, this rock shall fly,

From its firm base as soon as [.’’

And come they did. With Margaret MacKay on one side and Dot Berry on the other,
Herbie was the envy of all. But alas, for his
‘‘firm rock’’, which, in this instance, was a
sofa pillow. In some way or other it slipped
from under him and Herbie descended to the
hard reality of the floor. His ‘‘firm base”

AIR

 

In a recently published article, entitled
‘‘Air’’, Dr. Frank Crane exclaims, (and one
can almost hear him gasping for breath as he
uiters the words), ‘‘Air, just air, is all we
want, thank you; but we want a lot of it. For
*t’s worse to be smothering than hungry or
thirsty.”

The author, in continuing, describes a
show he had attended in an_ ill-ventilated
theatre as ‘‘a drama of asphyxiation with
three life-saving interludes.’’ Also, in reealling the village church he went to when he
was a boy, he says, ‘‘the gas jets vie with the
numan animals in polluting the atmosphere,
<o that I slept by and by as if I had taken
ether.”’

Doctor Crane’s article concludes with an
earnest appeal for a better appreciation of
nure air which he ¢ealls ‘‘the greatest medicine
in the pharmacopoeia of Nature.’’

But it would appear (so little do we value
fresh air), that Dr. Crane’s is a voice crying
in the wilderness. At Dalhousie, for example,
we apparently revel in stuffiness, and certainly dislike open windows.

The class rooms of the present Arts Building at Studley, to take an instance, are almost
mvariably stuffy, and quite often the atmos.
phere in them is allowed to become so utterly
noxious and polluted that it fairly reeks with
the odour of humanity.

One would expect a condition like that to
he thoroughly revolting and nauseating to all
decent-minded persons, if only from the point
ef view of physical comfort, leaving the
ealth question out altogether.

But not. Weloveit It is our delight and
our great joy. Or perhaps we are so habituated to that sort of thing that we no longer
notice it. if |

A forenoon spent in the classrooms of the
Arts Building at Studley is indeed ‘‘a drama
uf asphyxiation.” The drowsy looks and
suppressed yawns, which are so common
among us,, are proof of that. Ihave also
seen students sleeping through lectures as if,
in Dr. Crane’s simile, they had taken ether. |

Fellow students, I implore you to wake up

to the fact that vitiated and stagnant air is

a form of filth, and that foul air is poison,

just as contaminated food. is poison. Is there

not something wrong when we are content to
work in this kind of atmosphere?

Think that over seriously. It is not a joke.

Pine Hill Post

Yet another organization has been added to
the list of those already functioning at Pine
Hill. This time ‘t assumes the form of a secret
society or fraternity whose name has no significance of the uninitiated, and whose purposes
are entirely unknown. Much activity has been
reported, and it is said by those who occupy
rooms adjoining the place of meeting, that
weird sound# issue forth, during what has
been taken to be initation ceremonies. The only
information that has been vouchsafed fo the
public is that the organ zation is to be known
to the world as the Pi Phi Sigma Society.

Brodie Taylor, author of several lengthy
dissertations, such as:—“Celery as a Substitute
for Tobacco”, “A Ventilated Bedroom or a
Frozen Room-mate, Which?” “Physical Culture
What | did for It, and What It Did for Me”,
etc., has lately invented a trenchant: sloyan—
“We want fresh air, not hot air in the lecture
rooms. There’s a Reason.”

Carl Hood has at least some of the attributes
of a prophet. He sees visions and dreams
dreams and hears cries in the Malborough
Woods. The girls seem to be getting on his
nerves. He should adopt young Langille’s motto:—‘‘Never look at a woman and she won't
look at you”.

The Pine Hill Gaelic Society starred ‘n the
reproduction of a Cape Breton ‘Tucking’ frolic
at Nelson Hall last Thursday night. When
Malcolm MacMillan stepped forward to sng
of the Dispersion of the Highlanders, all the
girls in the audience ‘nstinctively began to use
their powder puffs, while the older ladies murmured “Oh? what a pretty boy.” It may have
been ‘make-up’ but we rather suspect that
Kenny MacLean was blushing during the
‘square’ dance.

Dunphy is leading the Moustache Growing
Competition“ by at least half an inch. Gerry
Olmstead has dropped out of the race. “Some
‘men’ ”, says Gerry, “are afflicted with a bald
head: I am afflicted with a bald face’.

The ‘Pepper Box’ appeared last week and
was transported to ts appointed place ii the
prayer room with due ceremony. It is generally
conceded to be a literary masterpiece, althcugh
the greater part of its material is of a libellous
nature. The part which deseribes the long and

hard ‘fall’ of our Cardinal, ‘Bearcat ‘Harrison,
is truly gripping, and after reading it, man

good souls shed tears over the wild, wavwardness of youth. Indeed it is a fact thay nobody

in the Residence has-come more completely

under the Wfluence of Terpsichore during the
last few months, than ‘Bearcat’,

In this connection however, it is only right
to speak a word for Art Yuill. who has assiduously, ) ly, and patiently attended

It is a subject in which he takes a great personal interest, namely :—‘“‘Women of Shirreff Hall

Commerce Notes

We are all glad to see the ¢xams posted
once more. They recall those happy hours
of previous years in which the scratching of
the pens over the accounting books was like
static on the radio.

However, we take great pleasure in an.
rouncing that the Commerce students have
already begun to settle down to hard work.
This fact can readily be proved by noting
the vacant seats in the front row at the
Strand on Saturday nights.

The news of the open-air rink is received
with great enthusiasm by the ‘‘ Millionaires.”
Some doubts have been raised as to whether
the talk will ever amount to anything. We
feel safe in assuring these persons that it
will not be necessary to walk out to Chocolate
Lake this year for a few hours of healthy,
pleasant exercise. We have often wondered
in past years why there was not at least an
open-air rink; some of us had already giver.
up hope but we know now how to appreciate
this rink. Sam we than
never.”’

So far this year we have had no outside
addresses tut hope to have some right after
the Xmas holidays. These talks are always
interesting and are well attended, not only
by the Commerce students but by members of
other faculties as well.

City League Basketball

Manager McQuade is working his men hard
in preparation for the City League Basketball games which commence soon after
Xmas. MacOdrum, Miller, Harrison,
Mader, Smith and MecDovrald, of last year’s
squad, will be on hand as well as practically
all menibers of last season’s Second Team.
McLean, a new man from Toronto is showing
up well in practice and will probably be a
valuable addition to the team. ‘‘Red’’
Grant is interned and will likely be unable
fo turn out this year.

It will be remembered that towards the
end of last year’s league, the Dal team
started to shew excellent form, but too late to
recoup earlier losses. The team was practically rebuilt Jast year and it took some time
for it to find itself. However, when the members become nsed to playing together, there
was a very inarked improvement. Considering this fact, Manager McQuade is very hopeful of resuits this year and is eonnofident
that his team will be a winning one.

 

Inter-Faculty Basketball

The Pre-Xmas Basketball League is now
nearing a ciose. This series has been easily
the best seen in the Dal gym since its opening and augurs well for the post-Xmas
league. All teams practiced considerably before the schedule was drawn up and most of
them were in fine form. Engineers and
Arts are both in the running for first place.
the former having played all their games
and Arts yct to meet Pine Hill Theologs.
The winners of this league will play off with

  
 
  
  
   
  

the winners of the post-Xmas for the championship of the year.

Results of reeentgames :—

Wednesday night:—Engineers vs. Theologs. Engineers kept their record spotless
by engineering a win over Pine Hill 22—0.
Pine Hill played well but could not cope
with the winners on the baskets.

Hewat and Brown distinguished themselves for the Engineers while Profitt was
best man for the Hillmen.

Line up :—

Pine Hill:—MeCuish, Forbes, Profitt, R.
McLeod, Meikle, MeLean, D. S. McLeod.

Engineers:—Hewat, Brown,  Langwith,
Horne, Allea, Doull, McLeod, Piers.

DENTS VS. MEDS

The Dents showed their usual good form
and easily drowned Medicine 20—6. The
Dents are a rugged erew and _ occasionally
show signs of science—especially Tupper and
MeQuarrie in their shots from centre floor.
Medicine should practice more.

Line up:

Dentistry :—Dunlop, Jchnston,
Dobson, M«Quarrie, Murphy.

Medicine :—Phillips, Douglas, Doull, Jones,
Baird, Hewat, Sullivan, Sutherland.

 

Tupper,

 

FRIDAY NIGHT-—LAW VS. ARTS.

After a fast game, which was anybody’s. it
was discovered that Arts won 18—12. The
Arts team plays a great combination game
and is in the happy position of having no
stars, or in other words, all stars. Law was
unfortunate in that an important previous
of her

engagement prevented Snodgrass, onhigh scorers, from being present.
Line up:—Arts—A Richardson, Mel.ennan,

Sperry, Doyle, McIntosh, Ross, Smith, Frame.

Law—Gushue, Morrison, W. Richardson,
Coughlan, Moore, Keer.

Saturday Afternoon:

Dentistry, Law and Arts were the winners,
defeating Pine Hill, Meds, and Engineers
respectively.

Line ups as before.

SHE KEPT HER WORD.

THE DALHOUSIE

r

At Cambridge, England

 

’Tis not because | consider that | am even a.

memory to the students of Dalhousie that |
write this, but some of you may find something
of interest in the matter itself, for | know your
love of athletics and adventure. Leaving Halifax toward the end of last June, | was greeted
at an unearthly early hour in St. John’s, Nfld
by one Donald Clouston, and better, friend one
could not have—save one thing. He mistakenly led the St. John’s people to believe |
could still play Rugby—so one sweltering hot
day I found myself again’ encased in a yellow
and black sweater and madly attemptng to
chase a rugby: ball round a field. filled with
sailors and ‘citizens of St. John’s. Needless to
say that I only saw the ball in the distance, as
examinations, a rough sea passage. and hard
training at marbels were not conductive to
soundness of either wind or limb. However,
| at least looked like a footballer, and that was
something.

A few days later, still minus bits of my shins
and toes? | again went down to the sea in ships,
and in due course, feeling somewhat like
Jonah cust have after his trans-Atlantic passage, I staggered across the gang-plank into
Liverpool and England.

Here my athletic endeavors were confined to
croquet and drinking tea at polo matches—

> Ranelaugh and so on.

Feeling rather “hicked”—after some weeks
of this I wandered into Holland—and being encamped with some students there, on a wide
heather moor, | had occasion to don a Dal football sweater—(such things save laundry bills,
I’ve been told as a freshman). Said sweater
led to eftquiries, and I not knowmg Dutch was
led off to engage in a soccer match, The day
was wet, the ball heavy—and neither |. nor mv
South African friend had occasion to explain
after the game that we had never played soccer
before.

On leaving camp for the railway—some
three miles away—I was presented with a
bicycle “to shorten the voyage.” Now bicycles
and I had never been really well acquainted
in the past—but how could th’s be admitted to
my Dutch friends who couldn’t understand me
anyway? With teeth set, | mounted that
cursed machine, -and followed by some six
others I started for town. The narrow path led
through bogs, sand pits and through a pine
wood, and ‘nto all of these that bewitched
machine carried me. However. by. dint = perwell”’—

Dal sweater stood for the livery of Satan—
initial and all—but apart from swimming~and
canoeing | led a life of comparative indoience.

Thence to Prague by way of Dresden, and
from Prague, disguised as “Pan Swoboda,” |
eventually arrived in Warsaw to attend the
Triennial Congress of the “Confederation Internationale des., Etudiants.” . Among other
things, we .engaged in. athletic competitions
with real athletes from other nations, jn the
grand march past before the President, America led off with one lone representat've, ‘but
he, was “one of the best.” - Angleterre was
nobly represented. by a New. Zealander, an
Irishman from Dublin. and two Scotties in
kilts. . My only regret was that Canada was
too busy ‘at the time elsewhere to turn out in
feathers, war paint and tomahawk. |

Later, however, the British delegation did
manage to collect enough males to form a soccer team and play against the champions of
Poland. Some of us had seen a soccer ball
‘n shop windows before, and | believe one had
even witnessed a match—but we did play some- .
thing. I having been told that full back re- ‘
quired less exertion than any. other position
on the team “fell in’ there and refused to be
moved. In the course of the game a brawny
Jock and I both “went after” the same Pole
at the ‘same time. Of course we got him, but
we also got ea ér. with the result that |
was able to \ Hungarian ambassador
that evening “war horse” style. The
Poles are still. champions of Poland, but our
New Zealand friend, who is an Olympic winner, has given them several new records in the
sprints. °

Returning via. Cracow, Vienna, Geneva—
(where,*by the way, |. was delighted to see
“Ned” Macdonald, who was very decent to me)
and Paris, my sole sport consisted of trying to
grind a soft spot on a wooden seat or sprinting
for a roll and sausage at wayside stations.
_ In Cambridge, athletics are very much to the
fore, and of a very high standard. The game
yesterday between the ’Varsity 15 and the All
Blacks was worth coming a long way to see.
The day and grounds couldn’t have been worse,
but the game was one of the best I’ve ever
seen; and New Zealand was lucky to get her

    
  

one try.

But I’ve written more than enough foolishness for the present—and I know others have
more to tell and can tell it better than I concerning athletics at Cambridge and Oxford. |
am sorry Dal couldn’t win the City League this

fall, but I hope the juniors have retrieved the

situation ere this. Here’s to success in other
