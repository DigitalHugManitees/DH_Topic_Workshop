Point System

The problem of obtaining proper balance between university activity and study is a matter
that has been dealt with before in these columns.
The proper medium can often be regulated by the
student, although there have been cases where an
especially acute acquisitive instinct has enabled the
owner to amass more offices and take part in more
apt meget was adequate with his capability to do
these things justice: At the other extreme there
ate instances when honors undesired have heaped
upon an individual because of willingness or lack of
will to accept or refuse such distinctions. Again,
it was necessary that certain duties be slighted in
the absence of sufficient time to deal with them.
The remedy to both forms of this same evil
must be some way of placing 4 check on the
niimber of positions that may be filled by one
person. The “point system,” : used extensively in
erica and on the continent, provides the means
‘of setting the desired limit, and its use would no

Acadia Trims Tiger Profs

 

EPOCH-MARKING EVENT

 

Dalhousie’s Professorial Volleyball Team
met defeat by a close margin at the hands of
Acadia profs, last Friday night in Wolfville.
The arrangement was that the first 3 games.
won would decide the winner, Dal won the
first game; Acadia the next two, The fourth
game went to Dal by a 15—14 score, and
excitement ran high as the advantage in the
fifth and deciding game went first to one
team and then the other, time after time, until
Acadia finally won out by about 4 points.

Fully 200 interested spectators saw the
game at Acadia’s fine new gymnasium. Dal
and Acadia’s yells were given with vim and
a spirit of hearty and wholesome rivalry lent.
an atmosphere of truly intercollegiate competition to the affair, the first inter-professorial Varsity contest ever held between
Maritime universities.

For Acadia, Profs, Ross and Osborne were
the outstanding players, while Dr. Wheelock.
played a ‘‘weighty’’ game. For Dal, Capt.
McDonald was undoubtedly the star. Prof.
Read played a steady game. Prof. ‘‘Syd’”
Smith was both enthusiasm personified and.
the means of attracting much feminine
support to the Gold and Black. Many were
the enquiries from the Acadia co-eds as to
the identity of the ‘“‘handsome young professor with the ‘‘L’’ on the front of his a
jersey.”’ a

After the game the Dal profs. were royally: Na
entertained at the home of President and
Mrs. Patterson, Acadia plays a return ed
in Halifax, probably this Saturday. It is
rumored that a Garnet and Blue vietory’

THE DALHOUSIE GAZETTE

Dalhousie Glee Club Scores Brilliant Triumph

Wonderful girls, wonderful musie and
wonderful daneing made the ‘‘ Maid and the
Middy’’ a ‘‘rattling good show’’ when it was
put on by the Dalhousie Glee and Dramatic
Society at the Majestic Theatre on the evenings of Jan, 28th, and 29th. This performance, without casting any reflections on last
year’s production, eclipsed that of 1923 in
every way and showed how the elub has
advanced under the directorship of Mrs.
Pearson. When one thinks of the average
college plays, this spectacle made everyone proud that Dalhousie could put. on a
show so much better than the average.
Everything went without a hiteh, and the
University was truly pleased with the Glee
‘Club and itself.

Including the college dignitaries in
boxes, the young profs and ‘‘married’’ men
in the orchestra, Shirreff Hall in the first
baleony and the howling, cheering, yelling,
mob high up in ‘‘the gods’’ it was a typical
Dalhousie audience, Out of the dim haze
high above seemed to diop on_ endless
shower of confetti, streamers and, now and
then, some other thing. But everyone
expected that, and these light missiles only
intensified the pleasure of the audience.
College and faculty yells thundered and
reverbrated back and forth from the heights
while all around was the continual hubbub of
the laughter and chee®ing of lively Dalhousians on pleasure bent. Added to this a
real Dalhousie show—and a good one at that
‘—and we have a real Dal night.

The operetta itself was bright and tuneful,
and especially suited for a college play. With
no plot in particular, except the loss of
{{ Anita’’—which keeps the piece from falling

to pieces—it gives complete leeway for extra

songs and dances. The entertainment s0

, aptly interpolated in the second act made

a real hit with the audience. Every number

was the appreciation.

The scenes were located at the University
Boat Club, on the North West Arm, The
club members were surprised by the sudden
arrival of Captain Dasher and six midshipmen from H. M. S. Dreadnaught. A Spanish

Count, and an old farmer appeared on the

scene and complications followed.

Andreas Johanson as ‘‘Billy the Middy.’’
sustained the reputation he made in the
‘‘Yokahoma Maid.’’ His dance with Miss
| ‘Valerie Vane,’’ the

_‘*Maid,’’ was one of the big hits of the play.

Both had hard parts which they did to per

received even more than his usual number of
encores.

Howard Hamilton and Ralph Dalgleish as
‘‘Dawson’’ the farmer, and the ‘‘Coupt”’
supplied the comedy of the evening. Howard
made a great hit as a hayseed. His song and
dance with the chorus taking, perhaps,
the best of all his efforts with the audience.
Dalgleish made the most of his part, as he
always does, and his musical monologue, filled
with breezy cuts on college celebrities, was
very good indeed.

Miss Frances Power, as Mrs. Gaily, the
young widow, played her part with the ease
and confidence of an accomplished actress.
One cannot help wishing thai the piece had
given her wider scope in which to display her
undoubted ability.

Arthur Youill-as ‘‘the great- unknown”’
was responsible for a large part of the merriment. He had a hard part, but carried it
out most suecessfully and his sudden appearances on the stage were always the signals for
laughter and applause.

Minor parts by Clara Murray, Carol
Hawkins, Roberta Forbes, Beryl Sims, and
Isobel MacKay, were performed with perfection of both art and charm. Gordon
Graham, Carl Bethune and Chester Sutherland also played their parts with effortless
ease,

Among the specialties deserving extra
praise were the several dances by Misses

they expressed the joyous spirit of youth and
beauty and unbounded life.

Strangely different in effect and spirit was
the step-dancing of Kelly and Rod McLean.
They staged a small riot.-.which - was only
quieted by the soothing effect of ‘‘I’ve Been
on the Railroad’’ as sung by the Serenaders
Quartette. (Fraser, Fultz, Cameron and
Wickwire.) Not to be forgotten is the work
of the chorus, for never were maidens 80
pretty (and shy) and never were middies so
handsome. All the intricate forms were
carried out perfeetly and their singing was
spontaneous and effective.

At the end of the first act the players
expressed their appreciation of the efforts of

“ON BUSINESS
yh ADMINISTRATION

oe Thursday Jan. 24th, the ‘ ‘Millionaire
Club” and their friends enjoyed ‘a very fine
lecture in the Chemistry theatre by Prof.
Roy Davis. His lecture ,was based on
‘‘Business Administration. ’’

Prof, Davis is an old Nova Seotian and. is
one of Dal’s most distinguished graduates.
He is now Assistant Dean of Boston University, a university with an_ enrollment
of some 10,000 students. Prof. Davis is also
the author of a widely used text book—
‘‘Business English.”’

The ‘‘Twilight Talks’’ at the Board of
Trade Rooms are still going strong. A hearty
and welcome a invitation was given to all the
Commercials to attend. These lectures are
well worth while, and are held every Tuesday afternoon at 5 o’clock.

 

—K. A. M.

With the Medicals

Dan Wood, Third year Medicine, has the
sympathy of his many friends on the sad loss
of his mother.

Our genial professor of Anatomy, Dr.
John Cameron, missed several days’ lectures
recently, having undergone a slight operation.
All were delighted to see him back again.

Professor E. G. Young, whoin Dalhousie
has secured from Western University has
taken over the Bio-Chemistry Department in
the new Medical Science Building. The
laboratory classes will commence at once.

Perry Knox, of Fourth year, has returned
once more to the calm and sanctified seclusion of Pine Hill. He states that for a small
consideration he will teach the freshmen there
things which Hoyle never dreamed.

Congratulations to Dennis Moriarty on
his new appointment which was announced

t the Majestic on ‘‘Dal’’ night.

L’AMOUR! |

 

Far away across the ocean,

(Right beside me ‘neath this tree)
Flies my love whom I’ve forgotten
And I’m thinking now of she!

She was fair as Hindu maiden
—Cheeks as pale as any beet—

And her hair which she wore shingled
Fell in ringlets to her feet.

Long before I ever saw her,
How I loved her—’pon my soul!
But she spurned me, tho’ I leved her—
Yes I loved her—father’s roll!
. —F.

 

The boys in third year Dentistry are getting very ambitious about getting their technic
work done, and a close and exciting race is
now on between Lavers and Willigar who are
neck and neck for first place, with ‘‘Jazzer’’
Brown the dark horse from Dartmouth also
in the running.

‘‘Sandy’’ the official referee ftnds his time —

fully oceupied keeping the contestants inside
union hours and his daily orations on the
status of a ‘‘seab’’ shows that his work last
summer as a strike breaker was not in vain.

Dame Rumor has it that Earle Green and
Louis Johnson spend their evenings instructing young ladies particularly those from the
V. G. in the art of figure skating. The professional terms they employ have completely
bewildered Losoda who can’t get over the
idea that the ‘‘Dutch Roll’’ is not good to
eat.

The Dental hockey squad has had several:
practices and manager Turnbull reports that
the team is shaping up well.

SENIOR GIRLS’ LAST FEED

—

On Wednesday evening the girls of Class
24 held their annual ‘‘feed’’ at the Murray
Homestead. Everyone agreed that it exeeeded all previous ones, both in appearance and
*“eats.’’

The tables were tastefully decorated with
black and gold streamers, also roses. A
picture of the girls who belonged to the Class:
in its Sophomore year was over the mantle,
while Dalhousie banners and eandles completed a gala picture.

After doing justice to the numerous dishes.
of dainties, all engaged in a pleasant chat.
Miss Marjorie Campbell, Vice-President of
the class, called on several of the girls for
toasts. Miss Harvey in her pleasing speech
boosted ‘‘Our University’’ and its advantages
and privileges. Miss Power toasted ‘‘Our
professors.’’; Miss Murray ‘‘The girls of
Shirreff Hall’’; Miss Mader—‘‘The town
girls’’; and last Miss MacKean ‘‘Class ’24.’”

Due to a skating session several of the
girls had to hurry away. The happy feast
ended by a Variety Chorus and ‘‘ Three
Cheers for Class ’24.’’

Many thanks are due Miss MacKean, Miss:
MacKay, Miss King and several others who
made ’24’s last feed the best one of all.

A Pleasant Party

 

The Freshman class have recovered from
their ‘‘first’’ disappointment; anyone who
saw them Friday night, Jan. 15, would say
they still enjoyed life. The weather man did
not favor them, and instead of the sleigh
drive or theatre party, they had a dance at.
the home of Avis Marshall, Oxford St.
Everyone was glad things turned out as they
did, especially A. Freeman.

The Class orchestra furnished excellent
music. The chaperones were Miss Lowe,

FRESHMAN |

Until two more should come to make up a
real game, the Lunenburger and the Dartmouthite sat playing Dutch Bridge. The
fact that they had already spent two hours
at bridge, that one had skipped one class, the
other two, meant nothing to them, for they
were real enthusiasts, and deserved credit
for their opinion that bridge is a game to be
played and class work a game to renigue at.
I wish I had their nerve; I’d be with them.
But the thought of an attendance record has
on me the effect of Limburger on atmosphere ;
the sight of one professor with a pencil in his
hand will permeate me with an odour of work
and respectability such that before now I
have been mistaken for a freshman.

As I say, they played Dutch Bridge; and
that to Bridge, is ginger-pop to forty-rod;
and Dartmouth felt upon him the necessity
of conversation.

‘Talking of ferry-boats,’’ said he, ‘‘ferryboats, professors, and such, what d’you think
of the freshman elass?’’

‘*‘Not bad,’’ admitted Lunenburg. ‘‘But

i

there was only one freshman class / ever ad
mired, For nerve, spunk, pluck, ability, and
women, I never saw it equalled. It was never
hazed; it never could be hazed. Why, we
razzed the Senate and got away with it;
we—”’

“‘Oh—your elass?’’ asked Dartmouth.

‘‘Sure,’’ said Lunenburg, ‘‘ Whose else?
But there is one. freshman this year that I
admire. The ambitions that man ealls his
own could never have been aequired. They
were a gift. He had been in the city two
days and not registered yet, and he had decided for a start to play on the first Rugby
team and to rush a senior Delta Gamma. —

‘‘He went to three dances with the sole object—he didn’t dance—of meeting a senior—
‘But she must be pretty,’ he told me—and

so, would she attend the Majestic with him
next evening? Curiously—he thought it was
curious—the first part of his proposal was
unanimously turned down by the senior class.
I pointed out to ~ that the girls might pre
fer to dance; and suggested that he come

down a notch, and try a junior.

‘‘From the first he played football, or tried

know, for I was in his room about a week
after he dropped football and he had pictures!
—my gosh!: he had the whole team
individually and collectively in every picture that had been snapped or posed
for this season; and he wanted me to
sit down and give a life history and ecommentary of the whole fifteen. He wouldn’t talk
anything but football exeept when he began

to dream—out loud—of the senior he would '

I met him no more than [ could help. ‘‘How

of boots and a pair of socks on between them,

forever springing on me.

The Wednesday after Thanksgiving I was
downtown heading for the Shanghai for supper, when I saw the freshie about a block
ahead on Barrington, waiting for a Belt line
ear to go by before he crossed over. I saw a
girl start across ahead of him, in front of the

The Wheel of Time.

It so happened, that there lived insa: little
tin-ean hamlet of Nova Scotia, that Province
of apple blossoms and racing schooners,’ a
certain mosquito-bitten stubble. clipper by

name MacBarron ; upen whom the padre, aid
ed and abetted by near relatives, tacked ‘the
title “Napoleon”? and clinched it there with a
gallon of bog water. :

Napoleon, or ‘‘ Boney as oe ‘was called by
the neighbors’ children, grew up from a ragged urchin to mature stature, eut his wisdom
teeth, learned to drink home-brew, smoke
cigarettes and say ae” with ease and
gracefulness..... re

When old Pa Time had spun his big pinwheel around into the nineteen hundred and
twenty-third revolution, Boney was up at
Dalhousie, shaving twice. a week, wearing
silk socks, whistling that story about not
having any bananas and making love to all

. the beauteous caleimined damsels at Shirreff

Hall, who would glance shyly sideways _beneath their fuzzy foreloeks and murmur ‘‘Oh
girls, isn’t he just G-r-a-n-d,’’

One maiden in particular struck his
fancy,—a sweet young thing composed mostly
of alabastine, silk stockings, wonderful eyes
and a more wonderful appetite for ice cream.
To her the amarous Boney paid his court and
on her he spent, his change with varying
Success, and would march off to the Bagdad
with the air of a conqueror and while the
saxaphones . played ‘‘Barney  Google’’
would shoot successive shots of ‘* Haig
punch’’ down his throat to celebrate the 
victory.

After the Spring Exams were written tie
got-a notice from the Committee of Studies
that he was down in all his exams. So he
retired to the garden of taters and buckwheat
to work out a misealeulated career, flirting
with bootleggers and dodging prohibition
officers: ’till that old boy with the seythe
came strolling around, tapped him on the
mre "’ and said ‘‘Come along with

Pine Hill Post

Yes, Perry Knox is back again. Morris
Kirn, Robert Robb, Don Grant and all his
old side-kicks were down to welcome him
with open arms, and Dunphy, our budding
‘‘Firpo’’ met him, too.

‘‘Are you a stranger here?’’ he asked.

‘No’ said Perry “I laid the corner-stone
of this building.’’

The cheek of the verdant is amazing. Still
when one Hawkins, better known as John
Wesley, says he hasn’t met a good looking
girl at Dalhousie, there may be a fair excuse.
The fault may not be all his.

How’d you like the Bean Brigade at the
Majestic ‘‘Dal’’ night? ‘‘Of course there's
a reason for my good shooting,’’ B. explained
afterwards. ‘‘He snatched her from my very
arms and I had to get my own back somehow.”’

The spirit of spring and young man’s

 

fancy must have risen strong in the Pine Hill |

first baleony row. (And we didn’t think
Cardinals were supposed to do things like
that.) And ‘‘O Ha!’’ Did you sce Harry
Langwith? And did Art Ross have a girl
among the gods this time?’’

If you want to know anything about the —

Pine Hill ‘‘At Home”’ ask ‘‘Jo’’ Pringle or
‘*Beareat’’ Harrison.

With a sorrowing mind, Bill Patterson saw
his friend the Bishop growing thin from the
onerous duties that fell to his lot. So with
Harry Langwith, last Sunday night he
selected an assistant in the person of Curry
Creelman. Curry entered on his duties with
a zest unknown in Pine Hill, gathered up the
hymn books after prayers and carried them
carefully over to Shirreff Hall and back again
—and wasn’t it slippery and cold! Indeed
there is a subtle propaganda abroad that
certain selections of the Code be repealed in
order that Curry might yet attain the primacy of the diocese of Pine Hill.

Ches Oake celebrated his inaugral day
right fittingly Saturday night. Enough to

You have all read that ‘‘Musie hath charms

SCIENCE AND. BRAINS IN

BY DR. GYM. |
(continued from last week)

‘‘Foul Throwing’’’
Foul throwing is an important factor in

 

winning games. Every player on the team:

should practice foul shooting, as accuracy
will mean much to the team. In making a
foul shot, see that your feet are. well apart
and clear of the foul line, ball in both hands
about waist high, thumbs and _ first fingers
just about centre of ball, in throwing bend
the knees and lower the ball slightly, aim for
the centre of bank about six to ten inches
above the basket, then straighten the knees
and throw the ball with enough force to carry
it well above the target before striking the
bank. The higher the shot the more ‘‘English’’ needed. In practice make the foul
throwing as much like game conditions as
possible by stepping out of the circle after
each shot.

Dalhousie Takes 4 to 2 Victory From
sr the Wanderers

 

Dalhousie completely upset ‘old man dope’
at the Arena on Jan., 29th by handing the
Wanderers a 4 to 2 defeat.

The game was marked by speed, both’ tcams
starting with a rush and for the first five
minutes the Wanderers had the better of the
play, but from then on the Tigers retained
command of the situation throughout and
only good goal tending by Gabriel kept the
score down.

Fabie Bates, the Dal captain and centre
was the, outstanding star of the game. His
rushes and back checking drew him rounds
of applause. The other members of the Dal
team were not far behind Bates and all turned in great hockey. Lewis in the nets was
particularly good—having a lot of hard
shots to handle.

In the first period Dunlop and Wilson did
some great blocking and their splendid rushes
throughout the entire game were a treat to
the fans. Several penalties were handed out
during the evening, particularly in the first
period. After nineteen minutes of fast, hard
and brilliant playing. Haslam drove one
from nearly=eentre ice past the Wanderers
goalie. Besides his wicked shots Mont’s
poke-check is causing his opponents much
annoyance.

In the second frame Dunlop spoiled many
of the Wanderers rushes. Coke Cahill took
the dise through on a pretty piece, of play,

but Lewis came out of his nets. to. make the |

‘most sensational save of the evening. |
Temple Lane from an offside pass banged
the rubber into the Dal net but the goal was
not allowed. Wilson got the next goal for
Dal on a pass from Haslam, the rubber being
deflected into the draperies off of Young’s

But in the final period Young retrieved

‘himself and gave the Wanderers a chance
to ‘Rah’ when after six minutes of play he

~~ skated through the Tiger’s defense for the

Red’s first tally. But three minutes after
wards Hickey secured the puck and getting

the ‘reboutié 7 another
score. Fred Lane a few minutes latter

ST. F. X—2 DAL—1

Saint Frances Xavier won a closely contested victory over Dalhousie Wednesday
night at Dartmouth. The ice was°im very
poor condition and consequcntly neither
team showed up to its best advantage.
Nevertheless the few fans who attended the
game saw a good hard fought battle.

The Saints had the edge over their opponents in the first two periods, working some
good combination play in spite of the slushy
ice, MeNeil tallied the first goal for “the
visitors after fifteen minutes of play and
MacDonald in an end to end rush netted their
second. MeNeil, MacDonald and McKenna
were the stars for the Saints. e530]

Dal came back strong in the third period
and Langwith succeeded in getting one past
Currie. The play waged back and forth
from then on with both goalies stopping some
hard ones. Dunlop, Wilson and Hickey
played an excellent brand of hockey for Dal,
but had hard luck with their scoring. Bates,
McKenna and Haslam were off the team,
being barred from intercollegiate hockey.
Fabie Bates refereed the game in an excellent
manner.

Players.
St. F. X.—Curry, goal; McKenna, R, Mac
Donald, W. MacDonald, defense; Martin,
MacDonald and MeNeil, forwards; subs,
Sullivan and Michand.

Dalhousie—Lewis, goal; Dunlop and Wilson, defense; Hickey, Creighton and Johnson, forwards; subs, McLean, McAskill,.

Langwith and Clouston.

THE DALHOUSIE GAZETTE

Dalhousie Badminton Club

A meeting to organize a Badminton Club
among the students of Dalhousie was held on

 

Friday evening, Jan. 25th, in the gymnasium.

The following officers were eleeted :

President, Roy Woodill; vice-president, H.
Frame ; secretary-treasurer; E; 8. F. Piers.

The attendance was rather small, probably
owing to the bad weather, but as over forty
members ‘are now enrolled the club promises
to be a great success,

A ladder tournament is to be held in which
each competitor challenges the one above him
and either moves up or remaines where he is.

To get started it was decided to collect a
fee of twenty-five cents from each member.
This may be paid to Mr. Stirling or to
Edward Piers. égiste

Confused

There Is a certain young matron of Philadelphia :

who is a bit absent-minded and, consequently, apt
to confuse matters at times.
was fearful lest she would forget to order the
chickens in time for dinner. Throughout the forenoon she kept repeating to herself, “Chickens—
grocer—chickens—grocer.”

Finally, when the hour approached at which she
was accustomed to call the grocer, she took up the
phone and asked:

“Have you any nice young grocers?”

‘Why, yes, madam,” came in a surprised tone
from the other end.

“This is Mrs. Smith talking,” she went on, “and
I want you to send me a couple dressed.”

“Send you a couple dressed!”

“Well—no; you had better send them undressed,
and when my husband comes home he'll wring their
necks and the cook can dress them.”

~—Tribune.

Voltaire once said that medicine was the science
of keeping people amused While nature does the

ork of healiig them. The biblical writers
of the Chronicles _of the Old Testament while not
so abrupt and ‘pointed in their description of
medicine, express the merits of the M.Ds in a very
ironical matner, Ih 2 Chronicles 16: 12-18, one
reads; “And Asa in the thirty and ninth year of
his réign was diseased in his feet, until his disease

“was exceeding great: yet in his disease he sought —
not to the Lord but to the physicians. And Asa ¢
