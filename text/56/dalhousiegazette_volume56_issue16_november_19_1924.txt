‘CORRESPONDENCE

Editor of the Dalhousie Gazett:

Dear Sir:—In the interests of fair play I
think it only right to clear up a few mis» understandings in regard to a certain letter
which appeared in the last number of the « 7)
Dalhousie Gazette, signed A. E. R. It is significant that the author of this letter has taken
refuge behind three capital letters. We are
forced to the conclusion that he either feared
the censure that his statements would provoke
or that he considered that, while a full signature
might be necessary for others, mere initials
were sufficient for a man of his fame.

Some. time ago a resolution, supporting the ~ =
petition of the Sodales Debating Society fora >
change of locus, was passed by every class ~ =
in Arts, unanimously, with the exception of ~~
one dissenting voice. We would ask A. E. R. 3%
why he did not register his objections at the . |
meeting of his class where they could have
been more successfully dealt with than in this ©
limited space where it is practically impossible ~~
to set down any detailed defence of the merits —
of the question under discussion. Was he so
uncertain as to the soundness of his case that)
he feared to raise his voice in its defence?

His poverty of argument in the afceaes |
mentioned letter is so great that he =a

4 he THE DALHOUSIE GAZETTE

Shirreff Hall

Last week the dwellers on the third floor
were menaced by an enemy who threatened
to upset the order and happiness of that
peaceful community.

The foe at first strove to deceive the unsuspecting inhabitants by showing the playful
side of its nature and spent Wednesday night
playing on the ukelele belonging to Annie
Crowdis. The ruse deceived a few.

The second night, however, the warlike side
was manifested when it scratched and gnawed
at the back of Dorothy Berry’s head. Of
course it thought it was wood, but it should
have made sure.

Individual attempts were made the following day to annihilate, wound, or even terrorize,
the assailant, but 4.30 found him still at large.
A hurried meeting of the attic neighbors was
called. It was unanimously agreed to call
in the aid of Ikey, an orphan abandoned by
Angie McGee, and his companion, both tabbies
renowned for conspicuous bravery in action.

Just what were the tactics used, and how
long and fierce was the struggle conflicting
evidence has rendéred uncertain; but precisely
at 11.20 the heralds announced the approach
of the victorious army. i

Since then there has been no further attack,
but an atmosphere of apprehension prevails
which is a sad contrast to the former lightheartedness characteristic of the 3rd floor.

Quiet pervaded the 2nd floor as a studious
Junior hustled to bed at 1.30 last Friday morning. A few minutes later her first slumbers
were broken by a strange animal cry. Hark,
another and another! What can it be? The
third floor mouse? Slowly she opened her
eyes to behold a dark figure silhouetted against
the window pane. The electric light was on in
an instant and a large puss revealed. How did
it get there? The door was closed. Then she
remembered Ikey and decided that he must
have descended from above. Had he? Cats
are acrobats we know, but can they climb
down the side of a stone building? Jean
McRae says they can, going tail first. Now,
| wonder! Mabel Borden on the first floor

had a visit from the same puss and it was not»

Ikey, a few minutes before. At least Mabel

She didn’t see
her head and howled for help. Jean McRac and
Harriet Roberts have marked S. P. C. A. qualities and we know they came in from a dance

at 1.30, so we feel we may be on the right

track for an indictment.

Every Sunday after dinner Mr. Dixon officiates at the weighing machine. The results
he records are appalling. The prize winner
topped the scales last week at 156, but there

“They never seem quite to have their heads
and never seem quite to lose them.”

There is a tale to tell of Friday night and the
moon, of the Majestic and Shirreff Hall, of all
that happened in between and at both ends. For
you must know that the Seniors, burning wiih
desire for another party, and being, at the same
time, filled with that spirit of happy conservatism which is the glory of our race, brushed
aside with disdain such deplorable ideas as
“children’s party” and decided on that formula,
already mellow with use in the college, “theatre
party and dance at Shirreff Hall.”

In the majesty of our numbers and in the perfection of our dispositions did we advance upon
“Chu-Chin-Chow.” The ladies of our company
gave their full attention to the picture while
they decided which actor they would love fervently for that night; without a dissenting
heart-throb, we fixed upon Ali Baba, that adorable man. The gentlemen registered great
nerve strain at the crises, and amused the group
with their delicate wit, such bursts of emotional
eloquence as “Hot-Dog!” being frequent.

But soon we saw clearly by the writing in the
sand that it was time to leave; we boarded a
Belt Line car and kept: on. boarding until it
bulged; and thus we came at length to the Hall,

to the eats, to the fire and to Johnny. Frances

Milner, who was beset all through the show by

the fear that the sandwiches. left out on the*

roof, might be in dire need of an umbrella, rushed upstairs instantly to gaze proudly and fondly
upon them. The rest of us cavorted gaily upon
the flags in our usual agile manner and, the
while some of us pirouetted wonderfully and
some of us wobbled fearfully, brilliant and
charming conversation was in vogue, with one
sad exception—Allan Hill told only one joke.
Will some wealthy friend, who has the best interests of the students at heart, please renew his
subscription to the “Goblin’’?

And then, of course, the eats! But they were
so well dealt with at the time that we hesitate
to attempt to do them justice here. Suffice to
say, that the ma have organized a crusade and
their ardour will not be abated until they, have
attained their goal, said goal being to determine
“which girl made that chocolate cake?” In
order, however, that the young lady in tion
may have some little time to study before the
Christmas exams, the girls made a firm stand
and refused to reveal the name. Fear not, lit

LAW LUNCHEON,

 

Dr. Reed, a member of the Carnegie Foundation, was the special speaker at the monthly luncheon of the Law Society, held at the
Tarry Inn on Monday.

Referring to a newspaper report of his
visit, Dr. Reed disclaimed that he was here
to inspect the school, but to study the system
of law, that was most adaptable to Canada
and the United States. In an instructive
manner Dr. Reed compared the legal systems
of Canada and the United States, basing his
address on four fundamental differences:
First: While Canada had nine jurisdictions,
with a central appeal court, the United States
had forty-eight jurisdictions, with no central
appeal court. Thus the Canadian system
was simplified, while the American system
was a hideous garb of complexities. Second:
The study of Bills and Notes, Insurance, sale
of Goods, ete., was simplified in Canada by
studying the respective Acts in collaboration
with the cases, whereas the Law Schools in
the States, confined themselves, wholly to the
reading of case law, thus being unable to
cover as much work and were then compelled
to take one of these subjects as elective.
Third: That Constitutional Law in Canada
did not present the conflicts as in the United
States. Fourh: That the Harvard system
of case law, known as the Common Denomination, was recognized as the most adaptable
system, at present, for the United States.

In conclusion, Dr. Reed, for his own information, put a series of questions to his
audience, ‘‘whether a law student derived a
benefit as an articled clerk.”’ The answers
were in the affirmative, but only two plutoerats claimed pecuniary remuneration as
articaled clerks. — ia

Dean John E. Read thanked the speaker
for his admirable and instructive address,
taking issue with Dr. Reed, on one point,
when he claimed not to be an authority on
legal education. _ ge ra

PINE HILL POST

He had been contemplating doing it for
several months. At last, on Thursday, carrying
in his right hand a Gillette Safety Razor and in
his left hand a cake of shaving soap, Barney
Morton stealthily made his way to the lavatory
and there indulged in the luxury of his first
shave. Congratulations, Barney. The next
thing we know Allison Cumming will be  following your example.

Thanksgiving Day at the Residence was
memorable for three outstanding events. First,

the football game between two portions of the

Residence at which Sutherland MacLeod would
have made a touchdown had he not. gone to

_ the wrong end of the field and made a “safety”

instead.

Secondly, there was the dinner which, in
Charlie Jones’ opinion, was by far the most
important event of the day. It was certainly
a good dinner and he was a stout man and
valiant who followed it through to the end
without faltering, although Bearcat Harrison
says that he could have eaten another mince
pie had he not been burdened down with three
sweaters.

The last, and in the opinion of Tom Humphrey, the most notorious event of the day, was
the appearance, in close proximity to — the
Residence, of a car containing Acadia co-eas.
The report was quickly raised abroad and a
crowd collected. Art Forbes went upstairs three
steps at a time to get on his wing collar and
bow tie. George MacLeod got out his handbook and tried to give the Acadia yell, but had
to stop in the midst of it to save Bill Firth
who had leaned out of the window so far that
he lost his balance.

Fortunately before it was necessary to send
in a riot calt to the police the car was moved
on and the crowd dispersed.

It would be a serious admission did we neglect to mention the recent valiant efforts of
“Jiggie’ Grant to promote the introduction

of corned beef and cabbage as a part of the Pine Hill menu. He pleaded the cause of cab- |

bage before the student body with great unction
got to no avail, All of which goes to show
that the etymology of the words “Jiggs” and
“Jiggie” is the same. Both are derived from
an unknown Sanskrit word meaning “cabbage

eater. )

WHAT NEXT?

 

If one of our worthy lady ancestors had
chanced to return to this ‘‘vale of tears’’
and had happened to visit Studley campus
on Wednesday, Nov. 12, she would have received a distinct shock to see the young “lad
ies” of t heUniversity playing a-game of ground .

hockey against the men. Probably her shock
would have turned into the keenest int:est and
+ wouldhay echeered for the young lacic: as
Fare as the rest of the spectators,

This game (for it ean hardly be called a
match) was indeed exciting—‘‘not a dull
moment’’ as the society column would say.
From the time Prof. Macneill blew the first
whistle to the moment when the last goal
was shot, the onlookers were truly entertained. To be sure .he score was 4—0 in
favour of the boys, but it is aiways the game
itself that counts. The boys played fairly
well for the first time. There are a few
things, however, which they will have to
learn, such as not waving their sticks violently in the air, not hitting their opponents, and
not trying to capture the ball by sitting un it.
But, boys, don’t be discouraged. You will
learn.

It is understood from a reliable source that
the periods of the game were considerably
shortened ‘‘because the boys might get
tired’’! Perhaps in the return match they
will be able to stand a little longer time.

Some brilliant individual players were
brought to the fore. Bill Richardson and
Gerald Godsoe were the star shooters for the
team, and Blenus Morton surely did run.
Walkie too saved the day by his brilliant
work as goal-keeper! |

The line-up was as follows :—

Girls’ Team :—

Forwards—H. Hewat, E. Macneill, A.
Clark, K. MacDonald, J. MacKenzie.

Half-backs—R. Bailey, H. Robertson, J.

TRACK MEET

 

Arts won the annual inter-faculty track and
field meet held on the Studley: Campus. on
Munroe Day, November 11th.

The day was perfect for an event of this
kind and despite the fact that several students
were out of town for the holiday there was
a good turn out of contestants and spectators
and while no records were broken the various
events were keenly contested and the meet we
generally conceded to have been the best one
held in several years.

Although all the faculties were represented
the rivalry was keenest between Arts and Dentistry, Arts gained a large lead in points at the
start of the meet by winning the first three
races, but Dentistry staged a strong comeback
as the meet progressed, and finally Sperry saved
the day for Arts by winning first place in the
running broad jump and second place in the
high jump and mile run, The final reckoning
gave Arts 33 points, Dentistry 27, and Medicine
third place with 12 points.

Sperry, Redmond, Keating and Jardine did
most of the scoring for Arts; Dunlop, Barret
and Godsoe for Dentistry. Smith and McNeil,
the only two entrants from Medicine, won 6
points each, and Brown, the only entrant from
Engineering, made a very fine showing and won
first place in two events.

Allan Thompson in the mile walk showed his
ability as a comédian and kept the crowd
amused through an otherwise tedious event. In
fact, he did so well that he was unanimously
awarded the special prize of a fur lined vase
with a sound proof bottom.

LAW AND DENTS TIE—NO SCORE

 

The promise in last week’s Gazette that the
fans would see real football was fulfilled when
Law and Dents battled their gory way to a
scoreless tie on Thursday last. The game was
replete with thrills, making up in a ferocity
what it lacked in skill.

Play in the first half zig-zagged back and
Louis Angel Smith was starring for the bone
pullers but the toreadors of the legalites were
tackling him from ankles to ears—Mush Marton, law’s fullback making one particularly
handsome tackle. The Dental three quarter
line was working well, while law was more
ragged. Wilson, of Law made a succession
of determined gains, while Snodgrass, the
New Brunswick flash, was tackling and following up well. Dentistry was forced to safety
touch several times in this period.

After a short respite, the teams, strengthened
by the discovery that the stands contained two
female rooters, again met with a resounding
clash. In the interval Manager Tupper had
succeeded in convincing his team that they
could bring home the bacon and Law needed
no convincing.

The Dents had the better of the territory in
this half; Godsoe, the Dental full-back, displaying rare judgment in taking all his 25 yard
drop-outs from center field. The feature of
this period was a long distance run by Wilson
followed by combination work by Wilson
that the line was several feet further on.

was ge the ball from the
scrum oftener then Law; but practise on knotty
legal problems had developed some accurate
tacklers in their opponents, who prevented any
score. |

 

 
     
 
 
 
 

The game was a good one, well contested
and fast throughout... The best of feeling prevailed, the law team receiving an offer of free
services for any dental work necessitated by
the struggle. and in return giving their opponents the priceless information that a landlady
has no lien upon the goods of a lodger. Monte
Haslam handled the game in a very satisfactory manner.

Line-up :—

Law—Forwards: Pearson, Coughlan, Chew,
Bethune, Hudson, Campbell, Woolaver, Proctor.

Quarters—Hickey, Richardson, Kerr.

Halves—Snodgass, Morrison, Wilson. Gunn.

Full-back—Morton.

Dentsitry — Forwards: Dawson, Konig,
Kaulback, Hill; Barrett, McDonald, Milligan.

THE INTERCOLLEGIATE TITLE

 

By defeating Kings 5—0 on Wednesday last,
St. F. X. became the winners in the Eastern
Section of the Intercollegiate League.

In the Western Section, there is a three-cornered tie with U. N. B. leading on points Acadia
is willing to concede the honors to U. N. B. on
this grount but Mt. A. refuses to do so.

them to do so.

These colleges should have benefited from
former experiences and agreed to some scheme
which would govern such contingencies as the

present.

 

INTERFACULTY BASKETBALL ..

 

The interfaculty basketball league commenced last Saturday afternoon with six teams
taking part, Arts, Law, Medicine, Dentistry,
Engineering and Theology. The teams showed
good form for so early in the season.

Dentistry defeated Law in the first match by
a score of 24 to 8. The Dents took the lead
early in the first half and increased it from
then on.

Arts swamped Theology in the second contest running up the large score of 38 points to
2 for Pinehill. Arts have practically the same
team as last year and played combination to
perfection

The Engineers and the Medicals furnished
the thrills in the last game. The Engineers
jumbed into the lead at the start and:at the
end of the first half had rolled up 19 points to
the Meds 4. In the second session each scored
6 points, the final score being 25 to 10.

A TIE

 

In the last of the series of matches and
practice games in ground hockey with outside
teams, the Dalhousiennes played to a tie—3
all with the Halifax Ladies College girls on
Friday afternoon. November 14. With Miss
Ward as referee the two teams played a very
evenly matched game with perhaps not quite
their usual pep. This is the second occasion
this season that Dalhousie and H. L. C, have
battled to a tie.

The line-up:

H. L. C—Forwards: C. Anderson, L. Barnstead (Captain), H. Hewat, J. Wood, (1 Burchell, F. Smith). |

Half-backs: (M. Johnson, M. Bradbury), B.
Grant, E. MacDonald.

Full-backs: C. Mitchell, (R. MaCaulay, W.
Mills). ffffiffl

Goal: J. Grant.

Dalhousie—Forwards: T. MacKenzie, E.
Macneill, A. Clark, K. MacDonald (Captain).
K. MacLennan.

Half-backs: A. FitzRandolph, H. Robertson,
A. Wilson.

Full-backs:H. MacKean, K. Holman.

Goal-—M. Eriksen.

After the. game the H. L. C. girls were the
guests of the D. G. A. C. to tea at Shirreff
Hall. Miss Lowe was present to give the
girls a welcome. Anna Grant poured tea and
she was assisted in her duties by Harriet
Roberts and Edith Macneill. A most enjoyable hour was spent by all.

 

Dal Professors Defeat Acadia

 

The Dalhousie Professors covered themselves with glory, and lived up to their reputation as shining 2x4:1)'2s for the undergraduate
members of the University. by emerging vic
torious from a fast and exciting encounter with |

the Acadia Profs at the local Y. M. C. A. gym

on Saturday. | bey
The Dal team had won a very close decision |

over Acadia in Wolfville on the previous Saturday and the Acadians came to the City determined to retrieve their defeat, and it looked
at the first stages of the match as though they
would succeed, when they took the first game

~ by the score of 45—6 and had quite a lead in

the second. However, at this stage of the
game a new contingent of Dal rooters arrived

and after hearing a few U-pi-D’s the Dal team

seemed to take a new lease of life, and treated
the fans to a fine exhibition of the game. By
their excellent passing and well placed speedy
shots to the corners they were able to take that
game and the next, and after a temporary setback in the fourth game, they took the fifth
and last by a wide margin, MacDonald scoring
point after point by his well placed shots. —

As every man played well it would be difficut to pick individual stars, but Professor
Osborne of Acadia must be mentioned as the

outstanding player on the floor
