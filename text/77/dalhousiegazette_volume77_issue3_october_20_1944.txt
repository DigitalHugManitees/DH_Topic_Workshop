Commission Urges

Health Insurance

People who complain of lack of
spirit at Dal should have been at
the Youth Commission meeting on
Wednesday night. There was a good
turnout of students and most of
them took an active part in the discussion on Health Insurance. The
meeting advocated a sweeping and
all-including system of Health Insurance for the whole of Canada which
would give all Canadians all the
medical attention required from the
eradle to the grave. Twenty students who had been studying the
topic during the previous week made
a series of recommendations which
covered the whole area of Health Insurance,and these recommendations
will be welded into a report which
will be presented to the regional conference of the Youth Commission being held on Saturday and Sunday
of this week.

All Invited

All Dal students are invited to
attend this conference which opens
at the Lord Nelson Hotel at 1.30
P.M. on Saturday afternoon. Registration takes place between twelve
and two o’clock, See local newspapers for the conference program.

On Saturday night there will be a
dance at the Dal gym for all people
who attend the conference on Saturday afternoon.

The first meeting of the Dalhousie
Round Table will be held on Thurs

Dalhousie Supreme Moot Court opened its season’s sittingS|To D.A.A.C.:

show that he is as tough as they are.

As a result they were

fined several times, paying for cokes to grease the gullets of the
Lords Justice, whose thirst was somewhat diminished for the
afternoon, perhaps setting a new precedent for Moot Court.

The case at bar was an appeal
from a House of Lords decision (the
House is the next highest tribunal
in the land to Dalhousie’s Court) in
the case of FOLEY v. CLASSIQUE
COACHES -LIMITED. Foley had
sold land to the Company for the
purpose of its carrying on a gasoline trade, and one of the conditions
was that the Company should buy
their gasoline exclusively from
Foley, price to be agreed upon from
time to time. The House of Lords
was partial to Foley; the Moot

‘Court reversed the decision of the

inferior tribunal. Only Heaven can
help Mr. Foley now.

An all-Newfoundland bench constituted the Court. Lord Chief Justice King was ably flanked by Justices Proudfoot and Barry. Arguing for appellants, the company,
was Thomas Gregory Feeney, New
Brunswick, while Abe Sheffman, a
fourth Newfoundlander, represented
Foley. It is not known how Feeney
got into the court.

Various members of first year
acted as junior counsels, and at
times as infants. (See “Without
Prejudice,’ feature page). Hickman, Ross, Mifflm and Blakeney
were fined cokes and crackers for
falling asleep, or saying the wrong
things about Newfoundland, or being unworthy of the ordinary attributes of gentlemen. A few cigars were also supplied by the delinquents to the justices.

Mr, Feeney’s presentation would
have been better for a lower court,
because the mannerisms used were
for the benefit of a jury, but his

S.C.M. Secretary
ec ca
Visits Campus

During the past week, Harriet
Christie, associate general secretary
of the Student Christian Movement
of Canada, has been visiting the
Dalhousie Campus. After graduating from Victoria College, University of Toronto, she served as
Secretary of the S.C.M. at the University of Western Ontario, at London, and later as secretary of the
Y.W.-C.A. in the same city. She has
had wide experience with youth
groups and leaders, and brings this
experience to her new position as
S.C.M. national secretary.

Last weekend, Miss Christie met
with the Student executive and
others of the Dalhousie unit to assist them in planning their year’s
activities. The conference was held
at a weekend camp at Jeddore.
Group activities and projects were
arranged.

During the week, Miss Christie
has talked with several informal
groups of students. The point of
the discussions was that the 8.C.M.
is a group of students who are trying to find a way of life, a philosophy, that is real and constructive.
They think that this is a logical
world, and that it is possible for
them to find out how they can develop their personalities to the fullest extent. They want to include
in their number all who wish to
lead effective lives, and be thinking
people. They think that Jesus’
teachings are basic in accomplishing
this, and the group meeting with
Dr. H. L. Bronson at his home at 10
Studley Ave, on Sunday evenings.

__ Where Are The Meds This Year?

Dean Grant Answers Question.

In answer to this question the D.A.A.C. at a meeting last Friday
elected a committee of three to investigate the situation and try to find

out why the medical students are not playing football this year.

This

committee interviewed Dr. H. G. Grant, Dean of Medicine, and discovered
the solution to the problem. Dr. Grant stated, “The medical course has
not been changed in recent years and there is no earthly reason why the
students in that branch of Dalhousie cannot find time to play football.
The Medical Faculty would like to see Med Students turning out for all
athletics as they have in the past years. The only solution seems to reflect upon the individual student and the question of whether he is as
geod as his predecessor, who was. man enough to carry the course of

medicine and play football too.”

Dr. Gtant finished by saying, “If the

medical course is too hard to permit an active part in athletics, then the
course itself is too hard, but that he knows is incorrect.”

So how about it Med. Students, will we see you turning out from now
till the end of the year? It is up to you to defend the name of the Med.
School, which i in past years filled about 90% of the positions on the Senior teams. This year, to date, our football team has no medical students

Lieut. popular

“Yank” as he was known by all
his friends, went overseas early in
1943 and landed in Sicily with the
lst Canadian Division attached to
the 8th Army. After serving in the
Sicilian campaign, his medical category was reduced and after several
months in hospital he was posted
to work at the base. Characteristic
of his high devotion to duty, he
asked to be posted for front-line service and took part in the heavy
September fighting in Italy.

Upon graduation from King’s Collegiate School “Yank” came to Halifax and entered King’s College. At
the time he volunteered for active
service he was a student of Arts and
Law and King’s and Dalhousie Universities.

“Yank” won many friends while
at Dalhousie. With a bright personality, he combines studies with
sport and made a success of both.
He played basketball and football on
the senior teams, was News Editor
of the “Gazette”, and was elected
Life President of the Class of 1942.

The letter, which affects all male
students taking training, went on to
state that a committee be set up in
each University, composed of a
nominee of the University for each
service on the campus, the commanding officer of each service, one
member each nominated by headquarters of each service represented and the Executive Head of the
University who shall act as chairman of he committee. The duties of
this committee

shall be to coordinate training of the services
with the acamedic syllabus, to establish policies of recruiting and
transfer of students, and to consider any further matters which

may affect the interests of the units
in relation to the University.

Hours to be Reduced

The most important part of the
letter, however, was the following:
“There shall be a minimum of 110
hours of intravenral training during the academic year, and two
weeks at camp in the summer vacation. After 220 hours of intramural

training the unit in which enrolled,
and attendance at two summer
camps, having been satisfactorily

completed, the hours of intramural
training shall be reduced by the J.S.

There were several other recommendations approved including the
appointment of a University Representative on the Joint Services University Training Board, the place of
service training in the Univercity
and the Appointment of Commanding Officer.

Another important section of the
letter was that dealing with the

the Chem. Theatre to organize the
Dalhousie Student Group of the
Chemical Institute of Canada.

Students majoring in any of the
branches of chemistry or intending
to enter chem. engineering are eligible for membership if they are in
their second or following years.

The chairman of the meeting,
Gerald Vavasour, outlined the advantages of being in the Chemical
Institute of Canada and the additional advantages to be derived from
the organization of a student group
of the Institute on the Dal. campus.

The meeting was without exception in favor of organization, and in

75% of students thought that Russia would be willing to take up

ents also thought that the United Nations League would grant all of
Russia’s demands as a matter of policy. Some 25% of students were of

- “WHAT IS A
UNIVERSITY EDUCATION?”

Cin reply to this question here is the 1ST in a series of articles by
members of the Dalhousie teaching staff)

Referring to the Gazette editorial of October 13th which asked
the pertinent question: What is a University education? let me
Say at the outset by way of comment how greatly I rejoiced to see
the students’ paper taking in hand a survey of the field of education. Perhaps we may find some things here or there that may be
made better. It was a very wise teacher who said long ago “An

}| unexamined life is not worth living.” Beginning with the schools
_ I think a fault is that some of them have yielded to a demand for

a vague and futile sciolism neglecting the fundamental disciplines
which help to fit a boy or girl for any career they may choose in the
days to come., The tendency too often is to prepare them for making a living (which of course we all have to do) but not to lay emphasis enough on the greater aim of making a worthy life, as the
President urged us to do in his opening address this year.

This tendency is carried on into the college days and the result
is a narrowness of outlook greatly to be deplored. It seems a pity
that some one since my time invented the phrase ‘extra-curricular
activities’ which implies a comparison or eyen a contrast of aims
and pursuits—a contrast which should not exist.

In the matter of games I would urge the students to adhere to
the old and well-established games which have been played on the
campus and on foreign fields from time immemorial, and to avoid —
bringing in fantastic substitutes for these old and proven forms of

strenuous exercise, and in general to spend less time in watching

BOOK REVIEW

SIMONE, by Lion Feuchtwanger, translated by G. A. Hermann
(Published by The Viking Press)

“Simone” is the simply told story of a young French girl, struggling
against the collaborationists and pro-fascists during the early days of
France’s occupation by the enemy. “A tall, lanky fifteen-year-old,”
Simone’is living in the Villa Monrepos, just outside the city of SaintMartin, when the Boches begin their march across France. For ten
vears she has been under the guardianship of her uncle, Prosper Planchard, ever since the death of her father, Pierre Planchard, when Simone
was five years old. Uncle Prosper had always treated her kindly, but
Madame, Prosper’s mother, has nothing but scorn and hatred for the girl
—the waif of a despised stepson.

Pierre Planchard had died in the Congo, instigating a rebellion among
the exploited natives. Simone feels that she has imherited his hatred of
oppression, his pity for suffering, as she watches escaping refugees, flow
along the narrow road past the villa, and pour into the city streets,
weary and wretched. Although she has always had the highest regard
for uncle Prosper, she grows suspicious of him when he will allow only
a few of the cars in his transfer company to be used by the fleeing
refugees, and when he signs a contract with the Marquis de Brisson known
to be a pro-fascist. Finally, when Uncle Prosper refuses to destroy his
company before the approaching wave of Germans has arrived, Simone
decides that the time is ripe for action, and takes matters into her own
hands.

Lhe book is divided into three parts—Readiness, Action, and Realization. The characters are like a chain of beads, varied and multicolored.
First, there is Simone. Graced with an understanding beyond her years,
she seems to grow as the book progresses, as her knowledge of the war
increases, and as realization dawns as to what her role against the
Boches must be. Then, there is Uncle ‘Prosper whose treachery and deceit
make him one of the most despicable characters in the book, next to
Madame who is even more despicable than he is. There is also Maurice,
the insolent truck driver, who tries to pursuade Simone to seek safety
with him in unoccupied territory, and Pere Bastide, an old bookbinder,
who lends Simone the books on Joan of Arc, which help her to live
through some difficult and trying days. Indeed, there is a striking parallel
drawn between the life of Simone and the life of Joan. Several chapters
are devoted to the influence of Joan’s career on Simone’s thinking.

The characters Which group themselves around Simone are both
friends and enemies, the enemies plotting treacherously against her,
the friends trying helplessly to save her from a darkened destiny. Yet
Simone faces the future with a high confidence in her heart, and a determination to survive the blackest hours until the dawning of a new day of
freedom.

TEA WITH MRS. COPLEY

(Concluded from last week)

 

“Oh Mrs. Bromford,” she choked, “Keith is safe, he’s SAFE,” she
almost shouted the last word. “The telegram—it just came. Your dream,
(Mrs. Bromford, it came true.” She covered her face with her hands,
shoulders trembling.

Mrs. Bromford embraced the trembling shoulders. “Oh my dear, my
dear,” she said breathlessly, “I’m so happy, so glad for your sake. But
come,” she said softly, “you must sit down. It’s been a pleasant shock,
but a shock nevertheless.”

“No-no, Mrs. Bromford. If you’ll excuse me I think I’ll

The call was over in a few short minutes. Mrs. Copley soon returned

Mrs. Bromford had disappeared. Yet she could hardly have left without
| Elizabeth seeing hef, since the telephone was in the hall. The door in the
hallway, however, was open, and as Elizabeth stood on the stone steps
cutside, she thought she discerned the dim outline of a woman, turning a
distant corner of the street.

That night, there was happy rejoicing in the Copley household. Several friends were notified of Keith’s safety, and paid congratulatory visits: In her excitement’ and relief, Elizabeth forgot about Mrs. Bromford
until the last guest was ready to depart. Then as they stood in the darkened hall-way, Elizabeth mentioned Mrs. Bromford’s visit, and how grateful she was that the older woman had given her sruch hope and comfort.
The departing guest looked askance.

“But—but Mrs. Copley,” she stammered, “Don’t you know? Didn’t
you read in the paper? The robot bomb—Mrs. Bromford was killed yesterday afternoon.”

Elizabeth stared at her. It was several moments before the look of
horror and bewilderment had passed from her rface. Then an odd little
smile crept from the corners of her mouth. She gazed through the open

hall door, and saw again, a shadowy figure disappearing quietly into the
fog.

efficiency and ambition shown at the

of one fraternity voting against the

A: word about the mimeographing
of notes. The efforts of the students
to obtain mimeographed notes reflects a sincere desire to improve
methods of medical education, and
the project was not undertaken out
of the slighest disrespect for methods
now existing, but the cooperation of
the teaching staff was sought for,
and in a large measure has been
heartily forthcoming. But much
more remains to be done, both on the
part of students and professors;
large steps are not quickly taken.

In an address given before those
attending the Dalhousie Refresher
Course, Dr. Mainland emphasized the
need for a revision of teaching
methods, and both in that address
and in a recently published paper,
Anatomy in Medical Education, outlined an approach to such a problem.
Certainly if no efforts are made toward revision, there can be no progress, and experiments can only
lead to results.

Because medical classes as Dal-housie are small and methods of
teaching flexible, experimentation
here is:a relatively simple matter.
With its wide awake and more or
less experienced body of students, and
its very capable faculty there seems
little reason why Dalhousie Medical
School cannot lead all other medical
schools in the Dominion in the re
vision and adjustment of its methods

of medical education.

LEADS HOUND'S LIFE

(Note to our readers: Last week
we wrote “Humanimals”. The >

girls at Shirreff Hall have expressed opinion, as girls sometimes do, that the story just didn’t
make sense. Quizzing the superior
male mentality of the campus, we
found a few who agreed with the
girls. But many males, the ma
jerity in fact, said: “Yes, we understood it. We could see the
point in it.”

And one bold chappie said, “Of
course I saw it; cleverest thing in
years, but I spppose you could
make a concession to the girls.”

The girls were right.)

Parliament can do anything except make a woman

a man and a man a woman.

And it can legally enact

that they are of the opposite sex. —Glib youth writing
a political science examination. ~

In one legislature a short time

ago (and we do not say where) the
preponderance of the governing body
was 29 against one lone member of

the opposition. Had not this lone
member (he represented a constituenty that admired his honésty and
fighting spirit) been in the Legislature, it is doubtful if the business of
the sessions would have exceeded
five minutes, and the Legislature
could have adjovrned for the serious
business of fishing. As it was, he
pestered the Legislature so effectually and continually that the ses
sions lasted several months, rousing

the ire of 29.

Finally the wrath of the majority
could contain itself no longer. Not
only had he kept them at their desks
on a hot summer day while an in-,
teresting baseball game _ beckoned,
but he also introduced a bill which
would have given a broad basis of
social security to the flotsam and
jetsam of the population. His bill
was overwhelmed as undemocratic.

Then a hurried bill, whipped together while members hurled sharp
words at the opposition, was introduced. In simple language, it provided that for the space of one year
hereafter the signature of the Lieutenant-Governor should be given,
said member of the opposition should
be treated as a full-bred bulldog,
with all advantages and social conditions attaching to said position,
and that on the conclusion of the
year he would resume the rights of
man again. To add insult to injury,
the Legislature formally gave him
a name, Fifi, which an unimaginative
member combed from the comics.

With a howl of rage the opposition stated that such an unheard of
precedent meant that any majority
could pass the opposition into oblivion by simply passing a bill declaring they were dogs. But his protests
were drowned in the general roar of
applause, and on the bill being passed, he was unceremoniously booted
on the rear into the street.

From the moment the newlynamed Fifi hit the street, he knew
that a dog’s life would be his. And
so sadly He went home to mull over
the local city laws relating to
canines: First and foremost was
the ruling that all good dogs should
have tags. He went to the city hall,
wondering if he should carry along
a leash just in case.

“I want to buy a dog licence,” he
said. 4

“Give particulars, please,” said
the clerk in the cage, who looked
like an overstuffed daschund.

“The name is Fifi, and the ad
dress...”

“Good lord, man, give your name
and address, and by the way, where
is the dog?”

“I’m sorry but I’m it.”

That took a bit of arguing. But

finally the clerk was convinced that
the dog stood before him in person.
(Maybe Shirreff Hall can get that
pun). He nervously pawed through
a sheaf of documents relating to
cases on dogs that had. been difficult to grant licenses to, but none
fitted the present.
_“[’m sorry, but we can’t grant
you a license,” the man said. “It’s
a ruling that dog owners have to
accompany their pets, and yours
isn’t along.”’

“Can’t I put myself down as a
free lance dog?”

“No, I’m afraid not,” said the
man. You'll have to get somebody
to adopt you.” Glancing over his
visitor rather critically, he added,
“Pm afraid that will be difficult
too.”

“How about you?”

“Good lord, I pay income, tobacco, road, car, tuberculosis, city, poll,
municipal, and heaven knows what
other taxes, and you ask me to
grant you this.”

“Oh, come on now. Be a sport.
Tll pay the money.”

“Yes, I could. But what would
happen if you ran afoul of the city
dog laws. I’d be responsible. I
think you would do better to give
yourself up to the pound right away
and be gassed out of existence.”

“Don’t be sissy. I’m going to see
this thing through. Just sign your
name on the dotted line and give
me the tag. I’m going home.”

“Home, what do you mean,
home?

Don’t you know that a dog

_If anyone was surprised by the
results of last week’s football game,
he would have been shocked to the
depths of his soul had he seen old
Willie Hagen seriously inviting some
Hall’ers to what he termed a “bridge

is quite possible he had something
other than cards up his sleeve. A

Without Prejudice

The Supreme Moot Court of Dalhousie University on the first regular
session reversed the decision of the
House of Lords in favor of Mr.
Feeney’s clients. Mr. Sheffman
argued mightily, but vainly, to sustain the decision of the lower court
(House of Lords). With all deference to the higher bench, I am forced
to think this action was presumptious.

Dalhousie Tigers, tasting victory as well as blood—and mud
