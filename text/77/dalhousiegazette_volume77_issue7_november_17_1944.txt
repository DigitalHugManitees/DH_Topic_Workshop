Additional Clinics
Next term it is planned to~ hold

further clinies, and, if for any reason you were unable to attend those

that you are going to help out after
Christmas? The number of Dalhou

the - attendance

in other clinics
throughout. Nova Scotia, it is true.
However, when we consider the
number of students at Dal. there
must be many more who could help
out by donating their blood—a small
sacrifice in comparison with the suffering that the boys who need this
plasma are undergoing.

The names of those who attended

we would like to thank them, and
also the several students who volunteered but who were advised not
to donate.

A REMINDER: The regular Halifax Clinics of the Blood Donor

unable to attend the Dal Clinics, but
who wish to make a donation, may
do so (and have their donations acknowledged in the Gazette), by arranging with the Dal. Blood Donor
Society.

At Shirreff Hall

The girl’s residence, Shirreff Hall,
was the scene of much gaiety on
Thursday evening, Noy. 9th. It was
the grand oceasion of the Shirreff
Hall Formal, when all the girls donned their long rustling gowns and
all the boys looked terrifically stiff
and starched in their tux, and tails.

The dining-room was colorfully

decorated in yellow, green and
fuschia under the able direction of
Fran Clancy. The alcoves were attractively furnished and all assumed
a definite homey but festive air.
Those on the committee were Annetta Goodman, Bobe White, Marg.
MacPherson and Kaye Whitehouse.

Miss Anna McKeen, Joyce Nichol
son, and Lt. Ron McBride received.
There were about eighty couples in

attendance including several. mem
bers of the faculty, who seemed to
enjoy themselves dancing with all
the freshettes. Indeed Surgeon
Commander MacLeod remarked that
he had never seen so many pretty
girls under one roof—no; not even
in Toronto.

Don Lowe played and dancing
continued until 1 a.m. at which time
the “welcome mat’ was taken in
and the boys were in no uncertain
terms—ushered out. ,

French Activities

With the publication of “L’Epitre”’
student French newspaper, and a
highly successful reunion of the
Cercle Francais Society, French
class activities at the university
were in full swing last week.

Presided over by co-Presidents
Harry Aikens and Rene Garrett, the
Cercle Francais held an enjoyable
meeting Thursday afternoon at
Shirreff Hall. Opening with a
speech of welcome by the executive,
the program comprised games and
songs, and was topped off with refreshments and a period of informal
conversation.

“L’Epitre,” in its third year of
publication, was mimeographed
early in the week and distributed to
interested parties on the campus.
The paper, which consists of orig- |
inal contributions from French class
personnel, is edited again this year
by Jim McLaren.

 

—— | PINE HILLERS HOLD

WEEK-END DANCE

Playing to a capacity crowd, Jerry
Naughler’s smooth rhythm opened
the Pine Hill semi-annual dance,
held in their spacious dining hall on
November 10th.

The dance was a gala affair, as
pretty girls, attracted by the charm
of the Pine Hill boys, gathered together from Shirreff’s Hall, Mount
Allison and even Acadia.

The Hall was beautifully decorated in blue and white, the Pine Hill
colors; the light’s were low and
dreamy, and comic cartoons dotted
the walls at regular intervals, incidentally nearly causing a riot at
the end of the dance, as gallant
knights valiantly strove to gain possession of the prized cartoons for
their fair damsels.

The refreshment tables were tastily decorated having table-cloths and
place-cards, and fairly groaned under a copious supply of sandwiches,
coffee and ice-cream.

The distinguished chaperones were
Dr. Kerr, Principal of Pine Hill, and
Mrs. Kerr, and the matron, Mrs. M.
D. Grant.

Murray Ranken, in the absence of
Justice Graham, gave the students
a@ hearty welcome on behalf of the
Alumni Association and read messages from such eminent Dalhousians as Ralston, who was given an
especially big hand; Isley, who, if
not known to the present day Dalhousians, is well known to their
fathers; C. D. Howe; Sidney Smith,

BATCHING IN THE ALBERTA FOOTHILLS
By BILL POPE ®

f A little white church could be seen over the hills.

the Great Creator of all things.

I was the Student Missionary, last summer, in Fishburn, Alberta, and

under my direction the services of worship were conducted in this rural
church situated in such beautiful surroundings within sight of the Rocky
Mountains. A short distance away from the church was a comfortable
four-roomed manse. Iwas to live in the manse—alone—and cook my
own meals. My first attempts at cooking were rather painful adventures
into an Art hitherto unexplored by myself. It was not that I did not
know of what a good meal consisted, but, rather, that I was entirely unable to prepare such a meal. I was spared a good: deal of grief, however,
as I immediately received a multitude of invitations from the kind-hearted
people of the district to have a meal at their home. So my adventures
over a large coal stove were delayed, and I determined never to be caught
home at meal-time if I could help it—although I did learn to make pancakes before the summer was over.

There were three preaching points on the Fishburn Field, and I conducted service at each place every Sunday. At two of the points the
church service was held in country schoolhouses. But the people gathered just the same at these schools. We had an organ at each point, and
the church and schools used to ring with music that came from the lusty
throats—and from the hearts—of these farmer folk. The services were
well attended and everyone was co-operative and appreciative. During
eight months of the year this distri¢t has no religious services of any

kind so the people are only too glad to support the church while the
student is there.

as

My preparation and preaching of sermons I found absorbing and
stimulating work. Likewise my pastoral visits were all happy and congenial duties. Due to the distances between the farms and ranches I often
went on three and four day visiting trips, staying a day or half a day at
one place before going on to the next farm. On account of the labor
shortage the farmers were busy men and were consequently not around
the house to any extent. Occasionally I went out to where the men were
working and assisted them in whatever way I could. Sometimes I might
drive a truck or a tractor, weed potatoes or stook wheat, turn a separator
or attempt the elusive art of milking a cow. I met the men in this way
so that I would become better acquainted with their work and their prob
lems, and thus have more tolerance and understanding of their way of
life.

The kindness and the hospitality of the people was wonderful. At all
places I was given a warm welcome and I accepted many invitations to
go on short trips: to Waterton Lakes for tennis, swimming and mountain
climbing; to MacLeod to see a Western Rodeo; to Cardson to see the
great Mormon Temple; to Calgary to take in the largest Stampede on the
North American Continent; and to Lethbridge and other places. It was
interesting visiting so many homes and meeting people of every description: the poor and the prosperous, the lonely and the sick, the regular
church-goers and the non church-goers, the gruff and the friendly.

It was a busy, happy summer, full of variety and service. Sunday
Schools and Young People’s Groups, statistical reports and correspondence, preparation of prayers and sermons, helping to organize a boys’
camp, assisting at a funeral, giving religious services at outside places
on three different occasions, making over 260 pastoral calls and conducting three services every Sunday, made the days full and the hours pass
quickly. The pay was small, the work never-ending; but I had the satisfaction of working with very honest and very human people in an enterprise that was both useful and educative, stimulating and worthwhile.

Rufus Rayne, however, had not
returned to Dalhousie to stay in the
public eye, the squirt! A group of
others were ranking high in the local entertainment world, setting
that campus wig-wag, the male and

*

- female tongue, into merry action, .

At Marmalade Hall, a pretty girl
paced up and down, in swirling
clouds of vapour suggesting feminine
ignorance, and panted, “How can I
capture Sheik-Upidee? How can I
gain his afflictions? Steal into his
arms?” A howl came from out in
the corridor, and the object of her
spasms came into view, sprinting
wildly ahead of a pack of shrieking
females, and growling as he ran,
“who was it said the safest place in
a war was under the cannon itself?”

Blood Clinic Influx

Jumping to a window, he grabbed
a drain pipe, and rushed to the
ground. Six other engineering Romeos, startled to see their leader
disappear in the dust, ran down to
the Blood Clinic, draughted down a
couple of pints, and ran back to
rescue their leader. By this time he
had gained the sanctuary of the
library, and was safely hidden there,
behind an unexpurgated copy of
“Thornton Burgess’ Bedtime Stories”.

In English WUN a different scene
presented itself. Under the inspiring leadership of Doctor Burning
Martini,. the local Seotch wag, and
his prancing hound “Peetah”, and
Dr. Joweless, but mainly under the
hound’s direction, English stewdents
were writing “What do you think of
the Dalhousie Gazoot?” and doing
very well too.

Scoffman Quizzes

MecGosh and Mingle were lamenting the lambasting their front page
was taking. Inhibit had dashed into
the stacks, taking with him a copy
of “Esquire” and the odd Varga girl
to compare with the . “Gentlemen’s
Magazine”. Scoffman was dashing
around, pencil in hand, and saying to
people: “Now, you ask me the question. I always thought the Gazoot
stunk”, and getting a hundred percent answer for a change.

President Stunley watched these
underlings in action for a while,
until even his patience gave out.
“Miss Henny”, he said, “take a note.
Call Binn-et into see me at once.
Correction—call Binnet in to see me
at once. Magna mistakitudo non
necessa est.”

Vitamin Deficiency
_ The two chuckled as, one half an
hour later, they drew up the feendish plans to revert the campus into
normalcy. ‘Let us put it up at once”
said Binn-et, who had been suffering
from a lack of vitamin B-minus, in
. his English Chew lectures.

Rufus Rayn e F rom Rang oon

' A iniversal groan went up from
all sides. “Youse guys is kindly requested to attend examinations commencing at 0900 hours 13 Dec 1944 in
the Gymnasium. Quills to be carried
and clean shirt sleeves to be worn.
Anyone who does not do so will be
severely dealt with, there being
enough latrines around here to clean

Meanwhile, the latest COTC order
was a miracle of English. ‘“Gentlemen of this University who wear the
battle dress which is glorifying our
men overseas, are requested to attend a coming-out party for the
presentation of 2/Looney Stupider
who will give his inaugural address

Then came the faculty yells. The
Engineers were out to show their
stuff and their yells were far better
than those of the Meds. Ron Fielding really went to town on the Law
Yell, although it seemed that some
of the lawyers were hearing the yell
for the first time.

President, Speaks

President Carleton Stanley gave a
short address of welcome and friendly advice to the students, while
Council President Titus commented
on college spirit and said “it is
definitely on the upswing this year.”
He hoped that we should soon have
a University Residence for men, and
that in all probability the residence
will become a fact in the very near
future.

George Farquhar told some amusing stories of the Dalhousie of
yesteryear. He said he started Law
in 1907 and graduated in 1927. Well,
if he is an example of a twenty-year

the law course be extended from
three to twenty years.

This Smoker certainly put the
campaign for college spirit over the
top and we sincerely hope there will
be more of them. Thanks a lot,

On The Campus

Dalhousie military training has
been enhanced by the appearance
on the campus of a large number of erstwhile cadets from provincial high schools. C.O.T.C. instructors have found that teaching
the junior platoons the correct art
of sloping a rifle—a gubject which
would ordinarily take some time
with the practice of elementary footdrill—has become a surprise, with
the majority of personnel already
having some knowledge of these
manoeuvres.

Dr. H. W. Lea, head of the Wartime Bureau of Technical Personnel,
interviewed a short time ago when
in the city to meet with Maritime
University authorities, stated that
the government was well pleased by
the handling of the order that 50%
of students in several faculties, such
as Arts and Law,—in the lower half
on examination results—should be
required to leave college. He stated
that only one or two difficult cases
had risen during the past year, and
these apparently has been satisfactorily handled,

As yet nobody has come out in
University officialdom with a report
on plans for extra college seasons
for returning servicemen. Dr. F.,
W. Patterson, president of Acadia,
and Dr. G. Trueman, president of
Mount Allison, haye already mooted
such suggestions.

Wateh for an organized movement by. Shirreff Hall girls to ban
the asking of Dal’s males to the
annual Sadie Hawkins dance, if
the boys aren’t more receptive in
seeing the majority of girls get
out for other dances. Sources
usually reliable on Hall matters,
have reported that a strong nucleus of the inner clique that governs the Hall, has definitely stated
itself in favor of such a plan, and
may have a strongly persuasive
effect on the majority of the girls.
For example, the Navy turnout at

Question: What benefit do you
think extra curricular activities are
to the student in university?

Jim MacDonald (Pre-Med. ’45)—
If there were no extra-curricular
activities the North American Universities would not be living up to
the meaning of the name they have
acquired for themselves. In all
activities, whether sports, theatrical,
or literary, students learn to work
as a perfectly functioning machine.
Such a dependonce on each other is
essential for.the students to succeed
after graduation,

* t »

Janet Gillis, Arts ’46: Obviously the
student should practice these activities in moderation, devoting enough
time to one in particular, that they
may become efficient in one field.
No matter what extra-curricular
activities students take part in they
come to know those whom they otherwise wouldn’t know. Another aspect is the experience to be gained
from such activities. Book-work is
far from the most important thing
received at college particularly for
a girl because in a very few years
she will be taking a part in community life and should in her years
at college participate in these activities to prepare them for their later
life.

* * *

Barbara White (Science °46): I
very definitely think that  extracurricular activities on a campus are
of great benefit to the students. It
teaches them responsibility and selfreliance, and above all it helps shy,
retiring students to come out of
their shells and gain poise and selfconfidence.

* * 2k

Kendall Kenney, (Law "47):
Class, professional and other societies expedite a great variety of
student activities and fill a large
part of the non-academic needs of
the students for recreation, and for
developing qualities of leadership.
Since so many of the non-acedemic
activities of students are off the
campus they apparently do not satisfy that need. This lack weakens
the quality of the old Dal spirit.
Schedules of activities should provide an opportunity for participation of more students.

aK * a

Alex Hickman, Law ’47:* I think |

that the student societies play a very
important part in a student’s col-|
lege life, but one very impractical
and retarding result which may
arise from being a member of one |
particular society must be borne in
mind. The result may be and in
some cases has been that the interests of the students will be confined
to their own particular society, and
may even extend beygnd their college life into their professional career. If this happen’, then the accomplishments of student societies
will be nil, and its effects may have |
very serious and retarding reactions
on the student’s career.

Hockey Prospects
For 44-45 Revealed

Prospects for a good showing by

the Dal. hockey team loom very
bright for the coming season. Of
major importance is the fact that
the team will be in the hands of a
very capable coach, Vince Ferguson,
who did such a fine job last year.
Of equal interest will be the news
that it is hoped to get in several
practices before Christmas, which
will aid in getting the team into top
shape. Practices will be held on
Tuesdays and Thursdays from one
o'clock until two.

There is good reason for believing
that Dal will have a strong team
this year. Back from last year’s
squad are the same trio of stalwarts who formed last year’s defense, Wade, Graves and Thorpe.
Also trying out for the team this
year will be Pete Flynn, Jim MacKelvie, Bobby MacDonald, the remnants of last year’s forwards. One
position which must be filled this
year is that of goalie, and at this
writing there are three aspirants
for the job—Cook, Cunningham and
Miller. Up from Queen Elizabeth’s
team are four good prospects—Blakeney, Leblanc, Lightfoot and Simon,
all forwards. As well, there are
another ten or twelve freshmen coming out and there is a rumour prevalent that some Meds are planning to
turn out for the team.

All those planning to attend the
first practice are advised to watch
the Gym Bulletin Board, chances
being favourable for next Thursday.

BASKETBALL DRILL

All the lads about the campi
(Forest and Studley) who are varsity basketball team aspirants will
have their first chance to show their
wares at noon Monday, Nov. 20.
There are two teams to be picked so
there is plenty of chance for everybody.

ATTENTION GIRLS

Miss Leonard wants it known that
on Tuesday nights beginners at Badminton will have their chance to
play from 8-9, Fencing from 9-10,
and Archery from 10-11.

16-8 In Badminton

Student badminton got away to a
flying start last Monday night at the
Gym. About thirty people turned
out to enjoy this popular winter pastime. The badminton club played
host to Kings in a friendly tournament which Dal won 16-8. This was
very encouraging, as most of the
players were having their first fling
at the game this season. Although
not all were able to play in the
tournament, since there were only
three courts used for this purpose,

 

'the remainder were used by players

not participating in the actual competition. All in all, it was a very
enjoyable evening with everybody

having a chance to play. All those
interested in badminton are urged
to be on hand Monday evening's

Brothers Burgess Star

In the first half Tech enjoyed
comfortable territorial advantage,
due chiefly to the efficiency of their
serum, an efficiency that resulted
more, perhaps, from the method employed by picking quarter Ernst in
throwing in the ball, than from any
particular ability on the part of the
forwards. The stalwart tackling of
the Bengals’ backfield, however, of
the brothers Burgess especially, successfully thwarted every threat of
the Engineers. Wade, having aggravated an old leg injury, was replaced by Graves, and the latter
quickly displayed his right to a permanent spot on the seniors, even going to the extent of antagonizing
the terrible Hagen with a straight
arm to the mouth.

It was in the second half that the
Tigers really showed the stuff that
champions are made of. The threequarter line swallowed a vitamin

time this year charged down the

On Friday last, Dalhousie’s soecer
team bowed in defeat to a crack
team from H.M.C.S. Stadacona
which garnered two scores to Dal’s
nil. The play was evenly contested
throughout with many of the Dal
player’s valiant attacks on the enemy’s goal frustrated by the more
experienced Navy backs. The Dal
forward line controlled the ball for
a good part of the game but just
could not get the ball into the op
ponents’ net. Considering that the
Stadacona team has played for the
past few months together and re
cently won the Halifax district socer championship it can be safely
said that the newly-formed Dal
squad more than held its own.

Dal, Acadia, St. F.X. and Mt. A,
and outweighed the Frosh by far.

by a 5-0 score.

Allan Kenty, first wingman of the
Frosh, crossed the Med line in the
closing minutes and Gordie Simon
capitalized on the convert.

Bryce Burgess repelled many of
the Medicos’ threats and gained
much ground for the Frosh. The
game was highlighted by roughness
throughout which once even culminated with flying fists. Ken MeLennan carried the brunt of the Med’s
attack making several smart plays.

continuously during the fray by the
Med’s brutal assaults, they dished
out plenty themselves and after
many unsuccessful attempts finally
won a well-earned victory in the
hardest-fought battle to date.
