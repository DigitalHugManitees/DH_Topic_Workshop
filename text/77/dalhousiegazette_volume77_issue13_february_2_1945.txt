Shirreff Hall In Wed’s
~ Interfaculty Debate

Last Wednesday night an Arts &
Science team was awarded the de
cision over a trio of girls from Shirreff Hall in a very pleasant little de~ ‘bate heid in the Arts Building. Re
presenting Arts & Science and supporting the affirmative of the resolution, “Resolved that life in the

-1870’s was simpler than it is to- |
/ day,” were Brenton Gibson, captain,

} ss Jim Saunders and Gerald MacKay.

| The negative side was upheld by Lis
Reeves, captain, Terry MacLean and
Lois Rattee. Abe Sheffman_ presided as chairman while Jack Nickolson proffered some revelant  remarks as the special critic. Twentyfive students were in attendance, including eight females and seventeen

males.

Mr. Nickolson, in his comments
after the debate, pointed out that
he there seemed to be considerable con
_ - fusion among the speakers over the

_ precise interpretation of the word
e ‘simpler.’ Although Mr. Saunders

_ | produced a definition from the Ox
y hy ford dictionary stating ‘simple’ to

’ mean ‘not complicated,’ both sides,

especially the negative, were in
' elined to consider it as meaning

- ‘easy’. Consequently, Mr. Nickolson
said, there was a very wide field

/ from which to argue, for what was

easy was seldom accomplished.

, A very light and friendly spirit

prevailed throughout the deliveries

of all the speakers, Miss Reeves and

BOILERMAKERS AND THEIR BELLES

GATHERED FOR THE ANNUAL BALL FRIDAY

 

The above shot was taken by The Gazette photographer during an
intermission at the Boilermakers’ Ball, held at the Nova Scotian Hotel.
Spartan simplimity was featured throughout the entire affair, as evidenced by the table motif of ginger ale bottles, obviously the only

beverage present.

Gaiety reigned last Friday night

at the ballroom of the Nova Scotian
Hotel, when the Engineering Society
held one of the most successful Boilermakers’ balls of recent years.

Chaperones were Professor and

Mrs. W.P.Copp, Professor and Mrs.
H. R, Theakston, and Professor and
Mrs..W. H. Bowes. The music was
‘supplied by Jerry Naugler.

The turnout for the dance was '§
good, better than that of last year, |
and although exact figures were not.
it was stated that

made public,
financially the dance was a success.

Congratulations are in order for
Doug Clark, Pete Flynn, Don McLeod and members of the dance
committee for having done a HONS

Te Include Four Shows | 2% svvlied by Don Low’s

In a statement to The Gazette
President Art Hartling made public
the plans of the Glee Club for the
coming term. They include two
single act plays on the last Friday
in February, the 23rd, one three-act
play on the lst of March, and a
modern musical comedy on Munroe
Day night.

The local Youth Council is staging a show some time during February, and the Glee Club will enter
some short sketches.

The first one-act play is called “A
Teapot on the Rocks” and is being
presented by Arts and Science. The
leading roles have been assigned to

Urma Geddes, Marion Withrow, and
Hal Pearson.
Pi Beta Phi is putting on the

other play, but neither the title nor
actors have been decided upon. The
evening will be concluded with a
dance, the music being supplied by
the loud-speaker system.

The three-act play is
“Holiday”, and stars Bob White,
Erma Geddes, Art Hartling, Hal
Pearson, Nita Sederis and John
Meakin.

Shields, Corringham and Hartling
are still working out the script of
the Munro Day show. It will be a
unique affair, and will consist of
modern songs and dances, and much

Fate Of Engineers In
Doubt; No Commissions

This week Dalhousie Engineers
learned that their position is not
quite as secure as they had _ supposed. At a meeting held recently
representatives of the bureau of
technical personnel adressed students
graduating in Science and Engineering.

It would appear that only students
who have entered the
from Grade 11 and who have successfully completed three years in
engineering will be permitted to
enter technical colleges for the remainder of their course. The fate
of those who entered from Grade
12 and/or who are taking the de
gree of B.Sc. lies in the hands of
the Wartime Bureau of Technical
Personnel. Graduate engineers entering the Army will not be granted
commissions immediately, but must
work their way up from the ranks
in the Infantry.

Happenings

 

A clinical course of lectures is to
be given 8rd year Medicine at the
close of Spring examinations. Such
is the word from the bulletin board
in the Clinic. Such a course has
met, in general, the approval of most
students. Those who have to finance
next year’s studies with money
earned during the summer have
raised objections, at least’ in some
cases they have done so.

Also those who have already
planned interneships for the summer months, both here and in distant parts, have objected to see their
plans altered.

To begin with, this clinical course
is quite generally appreciated; one
comes to medical school to study
medicine. On the other hand those
who have objected have had good
reason to do so. It is a discouraging
and disgruntling thing to have lined
up a good job in good interneship
that will last from May to September and then find a small notice
posted informing me ‘that one’s
course is carrying on into June.

It is the feeling of most students
that in regard to matters affecting
primarily the students—such as the
matter at home—the students should
be consulted and have a part in
reaching the decisions made. It is
no matter of “the university requires’... .”

dents, then, demand of themselves
their education by the university, as
far as it may be considered a mechanism, put at their disposal. As far
as the university may be considered
a mechanism for teaching, the students certainly should have a strong
voice in how the mechanism is run.

A university, of course, is: much
more than a machine—faculty and
students render it vital. But certainly the faculty has not more to do
with the vitalization than the students have, for both are equally essential. Why, then, when there arises
a matter affecting primarily the students, are students not consulted?

Each class has its executiv@a—let
faculties consult them. The uae
are no unlawful crew, but redponsible, especially so at Dal, where the
frivolous run the show, quite a universally fatal course, and if responsible students are given responsibility they will carry it off to the advantage of the whole university.

Ah, lighter matters! Both fraternities have had their initiations, so
soon both shall have had their formal dances. There is a Phi Chi man
at Pine Hill who requires watching.
A short time ago he hung out his
shingle — quite legitimately, since
he’s been appointed a students’ house

' ‘pbelow-par performances. What a disanpointment!

Unfortunately, the team is not profiting from its misde‘meanors, but appears cuite content to stay in a rut until it is
rescued by the Fates. “Good Luck” does not win games—nor does
“Bad Luck” lose them. Only initiative and enthusiasm coupled

with a “will to win” psychology can rescue Dalhousie hoopsters

A CANADIAN UNIVERSITY PRESS FEATURE
By NEIL MacDONALD

BROADCASTING
OTTAWA: The present political situation in Canada, and
the speculation as to what will happen at the prorogation of the
House of Commons at the end of the month, has rather obscured an interesting situation when the Board of Governors of
the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation meets on January 29.

Kate vs. St. Stephen
Staff Sketches part of the

   

The only part of the agenda of
the meeting which has been made
publie is the problem of what to do
with religious broadcasts on Sundays when commercial programmes
want to move in at the same hour.
Church services in the evening have
an unfortunate habit of coinciding
with the best hours for commercial
radio features, and the whole matter has been brought to a head by
the conflict between Kate Smith and
St. Stephen’s Church, Toronto, both
of which want to use the same time
over a commercial station in that
city. The church has been in possession of the time for many years,
and possession is nine points of the
law; the threat to remove the Sunday evening service of St. Stephen’s
Church has met with vociferous protests from the National Religious
Advisory Council of the C.P.C.

Monopolistic Attitude

And that is not all: the CBC came
in for a barrage from the Winnipeg
Free Press (which generally supports the government and its agencies), attacking it on its monopolistic attitude, its inefficiency because
it does not have to face competition,
and its attitude towards the public—
that what it decides the public
should like, the public must like.
The positive suggestions were just
as far-reaching. The CBC, the Free
Press said, should be a regulatory
body, interested chiefly in seeing
that the air waves are used to the
benefit of all Canadians as the
Transport Commission policies Canadian transportation.

interesting, and will affect the future wot broadcasting in Canada,

tHow Is Your Conversation ?

In our reading during the past week we came across some very witty
and up-to-date conversational tidbits. Remarkable as it may seem, they
are garnered, with all due apology to the late Jonathan Swift, from his
Genteel and Ingenious Conversation of the eighteenth century. But don’t
be alarmed. Here is the foundation for a new book, “How to Lose Friends
and Antagonize People. Just try these on your friends—and watch them
disappear!

We wonder what has happened to

Ball Notes — Woebegone Boilermaker No. 1 was undoubtedly
“Shiff’ Wallace. Imagine him running around bumming dollar bills
and matches, all the while supporting his broken ‘braces’. And as of.
last Monday, no one had informed
him that it was time to take off his
bow-tie ... Two-Drop Burgess (the
elder) took three, was slap-happy
the rest of the night ... What Lennie missed by riding down in the
back of a truck he made up in the
back of the car coming home...
Looie, with one impatient hand under the table, pointed to something
over Joan’s shoulder. It appears
she fell for it ... Miss Foster please
note: any resemblance between Oakley, J. P., otherwise known as Gus,
and Griffin, A.K., (M.A., Ph.D.)
was purely unintentional on Mrs.
Oakley’s part ...The same lad
claims he has found a men’s powder
rocm on the Dartmouth ferry; at
least he left the car on the way
over allegedly to powder his nose.
Came back shinier than ever...
The boys would like to thank everyone who helped to make the Ball a
success—meaning, of course, those
who contributed cars, tuxes, and
permits.

P.S.

The T-Square reporter was too
busy with his own affairs to keep an

Girls Win and Draw
In Hoop Play

On Wednesday evening Dal girls’
second team won another victory
over the Commercials of Q. E. H.

the hands of their forwards throughout most of the game. Joyce Hart
scored 10 of her team’s points.
Lineup: J. Hart, 10; V. Phillips, 2;
I. Robinson, 6; M. Macphereson, N.

12-2 for the Grads. Dal made a
remarkable comeback and succeeded
in tieing the score in the last few
minutes of play. Lineup: A. Saunderson, 9; P. Jones, 8; N. Sherman,

ice Squad Draws
With St. Mary’s 2-2

In a rather dull game, played on
poor ice, Dal eked out a draw against
St. Mary’s, scoring the tying goal in
the last minute of play. St. Mary’s
had an edge over the Tigers throughout most of the game, with the tide
changing only in the latter part of
the last period.

. St. Mary’s were sparked by Godwin who scored both St. Mary’s goals
half-way through the first period.
Dal points were collected by Blakeney with 2 assists; LeBlane and Currie with one goal each.

The first period was mostly Sa.
Mary’s, with Godwin making several brilliant rushes, outwitting the
Dal defence on several occasions and
registering twice. Dal passing was
panenic Harty poor'in this period.

In the second period the Tigers

opened up a bit, Leblane scoring
from Blakeney. ‘Giffin, the Dal custodian made several good saves in
this period and again most of the
play was in Dal territory.
: Dal played better hockey in the
|third period, applying pressure
| throughout, resulting in Currie scorline on a pass from Blakeney. With
la few seconds to go Currie missed
a very close shot which had the
zoalie beaten.

Outstanding for St. Mary’s was
Godwin while Giffin played a nice
| game for Dal in the nets..

DALHOUSIE GAZETTE

 

Presenting; CARL GIFFEN

The Adonis picture above is none other than sophomore Carl
Giffen, pre-med, a better than average student and an outstanding versatile athlete. Carl drew his first breath amid the
smoke and stir of this dim spot which men call Halifax in 1926.
He received all his preliminary education in various city schools
and proved himself both in the classroom and in athletics.

“Gif” starred on the Chebucto,
Road School hockey and_ soccer |
squads when he was. struggling
through Grade eight there and then |
transferred to LeMarchant School to |
finish his junior high education. mk
LeMarchant, “Gif” was a high scoring forward on the soccer team and |
an effective performer on the ice
squad. It was during his sojourn at
LeMarchant that he took up the
hoop game, and he played as guard
in the school leagues and in Church
competition. Next stop for Carl
was Halifax Academy, where in his
final year he was a mainstay of the

hockey sextet. On the court he
played a starry role for St. Androw’s Intermediate and for the

schoo] quintet.

At Dal “Gif” has come into his
own, on last year’s mediocre basketball team he was one of the steadiest players and won no mean glory
as both a guard and scorer. This
year Carl decided to try a hand at
rugby-football for the first time and
promptly gained a wing - three -|
