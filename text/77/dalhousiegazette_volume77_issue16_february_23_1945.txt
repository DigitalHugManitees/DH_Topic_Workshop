A Frank, Unbiased Survey of
Campus Opinion.

--:~pO YOU APPROVE OF FEMALE

“* SUPERIORITY ON THE CAMPUS
, FOR ONE DAY?

hid Louise Joudrey (Pre Med 48): I
+  eertainly do approve of one day in
the year when all those frustrated
females can really do something for
themselves. Better make it a week
and really effect a cure.

5 | Jim Saunders, (Arts ’46): “Ah!
{ who can e’er forget so fair a being”
Ahem! “Female superiority” —
.. that’s a hard one to define to any
Mg mind. I often w@éhder whether it
_ doesn’t cover a period of time a bit
more lengthy than one day. From
f a personal standpoint I think it
a does, perhaps from experience, perhaps otherwise! However, if the
fair sex want to limit their bountiful activities to one day, I think I
ean safely say that I am all for it
all power to them for on this their
one day of apparent independence.
Surely the boys can obtain some sat
_ jsfaction from it also.

Irene Robinson, (Pharmacy 747):
This is rather a difficult question
to answer as we the girls of Dal
hk profess to have the upper hand all
the year around but it really adds
to our ego to have the boys admit
it for just twenty-four hours.”

Margie MacPherson (Science ’46):
“This one day of female superiority
is an excellent idea—especially for
male morale. It is realized that the
poor dears must ‘have fun once in
awhile, so at this time the gals take
pity on them and magnanimously
' eome to the rescue by throwing the
best shin-dig of the year.”

_ Jim McLaren, (Arts ’45): Every
oppressed, underprivileged group
_ should have a break now and then.

. That’s why Sadie Hawkin’s day was
f instituted. After all, what would
the cloistered co-ed do without it?
fa Like the proverbial ground-hog, the
 @o-ed deserves an annual sortie into
the great beyond. Having experienced, for a day, the thrills of an
organized man-hunt, and having
- eonvinced herself (for a day) that
_ she is a Boadecia in disguise, the
'  esser sex” can retire once more to
’ the lesser arts of cooking, knitting
_ and scrubbing—leaving the men to
| cope with the problems of a man’s
— world.

Bn Blair Dunlop, (Commerce ’47): I
> os that the idea is good as far as
i hy goes but it does not go far
a ~ enough. Instead of one day, no dif‘ so ferent than any other, being topped
_ off by a colossal barn dance, why not
‘A eee a co-ed week like they have in
every other college. It would help
es . a lot in getting people to know each
' better and also save the boy’s
"’y pocket-book for seven days. As for

. ee or one night of half-hearted effort on
~ everyone’ S part, you might as well
have no dance at all.

“EVERY GAMMA pa HER DAY”

The doom of Dal’s many eligible bachelors is being sealed
tonight in the murky back rooms of Shirreff Hall, when the
man-hungry Delta Gammas (as what gamma ain’t) gather to
plan their strategy for their big event of the year—the Sadie

Hawkins Dance!

Sadie Hawkins, as any fool knows,
was once the homeliest girl in Dogpatch. Her father, rather disappointed by the poor showing, made
by the Dogpatch males, hatched a
scheme to get a man for her. Seizing his trusty double-barrelled shotgun, he rounded up@the boys, and
thus began the first Dogpatch Marriagethon.

Dal girls, knowing a good thing
when they see it, copped this idea,
and for four years have been terrorizing the men of the campus with
the threat, either of being dated or
of not being dated for the Sadie
Hawkins dance.

Meds Snubbed

A number of despatches have been
received from Gazette reporter Meswith Inbetween, who has been combing the campus for advance infor
Girls Sponsor
“Service Dance” For
Navy Personnel

“The Navy’s here” was the cry
that went echoing through Shirreff
Hall, Wednesday night, when Delta
Gamma was “at home” to 88 sailors,
(84 “salts” and four others, we don’t
know quite what to call them, perhaps sea cadets would be appropriate) and the U.N.B. girls’ basketball
team.

The Delta Gamma Services Dance
is given each year as part of the
war effort, but the girls say it was
no effort at all.

During the course of the evening,
the navy lads saw some Dalhousie
talent displayed and agreed that
glamour and ability were well combined in the Dal girls. They heard:
Helen Garson asserting, “It had to
be You” (the navy, we presume),
Libby Guy’s desire to “Make Believe” and Lauretta Dickinson’s restriction to “One Kiss”. And at
that point, two Russians turned up
—Marion Withrow and Jean Foster
produced much laughter with their

 

| dainty (?) ballet dance.

Great quantities of coffee and

mation on the dance. Here are a
few of them
Forrest Building, Feb. 24:—

In an interview granted The Gazette by Roger Rhochi, well-knonwn
Med School figure, its was disclosed
that the women do not seem to be
chasing any harder than usual lately. A quick survey of Forrest shows
that about 12% of the students and
8% of the cadavers who regularly
inhabit the building have already
been invited to the dance.

Pamphlets Issued
Drafting Room, Feb. 22:—

The Engineers seem to have the
situation well under control. The
Engineering Society has _ issued
an instructional pamphlet entitled
“Balkin’ Hawkin’’, subtitled “Wolfesses, Their Care and Prevention”.
The feeling here is that with luck,
casualties will be light, and Engineers may soon retire to the ascetic seclusion of the Drafting Room
for another year.

Shirreff Hall, Feb. 20:—

Interview in an alcove at the Hall
last night; Miss Emmy Gigglin,
Freshette beauty, stated that she
was prepared to chase her man. A
friend, Lothario Lateleave, found by
co-incidence in the same alcove, said
that he would, of course, be running
with the rest of the rapidly retreating males. “However,” he added,
“my bunions might slow me up a
little.”

The Hall itself is in an uproar.
Women are running in all directions,
excited by the thought of getting a
man for an evening instead of the
usual Jeep.

Artsmen Popular
Arts Building, Feb. 24:—

On the whole, the men of Dalhousie are taking the event well. They
are finding out what it is like to be
on the receiving end of a date, and
the experience, to say the least, is
interesting. Dating techniques of
some of the girls have been critieized in certain quarters, most of
the complaints coming from aggressive pre-Meds, who find the girls
much too slow.

In general, however, the men are
finding the efforts of the girls satisfactory, and are perfectly content
to relinquish control to the women
for one night, knowing well who

ON ELIGIBLE MALES

Our day has come at last! Just
as the ground hog comes out once
a year to show or not to show his
shadow, so does Sadie Hawkins, that
gal from Dogpatch, come crashing
forth to hunt and haunt you for 24
hours. The famed aforementioned
Sadie is a mussible critter—a body
of sorts—limbs of all sorts—a decided neck—and a head of no account—but in her eyes she has that
desperate look. She is eligible, she
is ugly, she uses Mule’ Delight Soap
and is a strong protestor against
the “Lily White League” and the
“Sweet Innocent Society’—she loves
love.

For 364 days every year our crafty
Sadie eagerly awaits the 365th day
which this year falls on Feb. 28th.
All you men-folks have a sporting
chance. Beware! Run fast and escaps the yoke of matrimony. This
year Sadie has increased her number of followers—especially on the
Dal campus —and from what has
been overheard at Marmalade Hovel
the general theme seems to be rte
“We uns aim to marry up wif yo.”
Marryin’ Sam promises to be on
hand at 9 p.m. at the Gym, so boys
run fo’ yoh lives and bachelorhood.

By fair means and foul] these foxy
schemin’ gals will lure you with
their beguiling charms — with tattered and scattered skirts—to the
Dogpatch Jamboree. You will be invited with honeyed words, called for
and squired to the Gym, presented
with a famed carrot-onion corsage
and fed with the best preserved tur-.
nips this side of Dogpatch. Then,
when you are in this contented mellowed stage and feeling prone to
mooing like a cow— you'd better
watch out, becoz yoh life is at a
crucial moment and we all hear the
rattle of that ball and chain being
rolled out of some dark corner where
it has been carefully and hopefully
guarded ever since it missed its cue
the year before.

The senior co-eds seem to be acting peculiarly already. They are

JUNIOR PROM GREAT SUCCESS

The Junior Prom held in honor
of the Class of ’45 on Friday night
has been the talk of the campus for
the past few days. Tables, gaily

decorated with Valentine tablecloths,

small decorations of hearts and
cupids, pusch, cake and ice cream,
novelty crackers, and the fact that
it was a formal in the Gym, all went
towards making this one of the most
outstanding dances of the year. Receiving were Prof. and Mrs. Bennet,
Dr. and Mrs. Bell, Barbara Campbell, president of the Class of ’46,
and Stu Maddin. The success of this
dance is largely due to the efforts of
Al Myrden, the convenor of the committee in charge.

Year's Activities Outlined
By Delta Gamma President

Delta Gamma is a society
and includes in its membership

exclusive to Dalhousie campus
all female students who hold a

Student Council ticket. There are three general meetings every
year, each preceded by an executive meeting. The first (October)
and last (March) general meetings are held at Shirreff Hall

and refreshments are served.

The second (January) meeting
Under the following headings will

be given a brief outline of Delta Gamma activities for this year:

War Work

Delta Gamma
girls work at
canteens, hostels,
the magazine exchange, Canadian
Legion Library,
Red Cross and answer emergency
calls, such as selling war- saving
stamps at the
theatres or issuing ration books
at the various centres.

 

M. Morrison

Many of the girls have given blood
several times. The girls also do
much knitting for the Services and
I.0.D.E. chapters. War work convenors: Mary Macdonald, Thora
Reid, Heather Prentice, Norma Sherman.

This year Delta Gamma held one
Open House, which was very successful and much enjoyed by all.
This is a traditional dance held at
Shirreff Hall to which the girls ask
the boys as a means of entertaining
them.

Two years ago, Delta Gamma established a precedent by entertaining men of the Air Force at a dance
at Shirreff Hall, as part of their
War Effort. This was repeated last
year, the Navy having been chosen
that time. This year we have followed the same procedure, and
Wednesday, Feb. 21, ratings from
H.M.C.S. Stadacona danced to the
music of Don Murray’s orchestra
and watched a floor show at intermission, after which refreshments
were served.

At Henceforth Delta Gamma will be a debating society.”

However, in 1938, due to the impetus of enthusiastic

_ “Instead of the annual tea dance in November an informal

dance was held at Shirreff Halli which was one of the most successful in Delta Gamma’s history.” Thus Delta Gamma has

Pada is Raddall Interviewed

 

GAZETTE

by Gazette Staff Writer

Novelist Gives Frank Answers to Questions

by NITA SIDERIS

Everyone, even a college student, has his own ideas of the
post-war world, but few merit the attention that do those of
Thomas H. Raddall, well-known author of such noted books as
“His Majesty’s Yankees”, “Roger Sudden”, etc. In an interview
this week, Mr. Raddall, now residing in Liverpool, N. S., gave

us the following comment:

_ »*T am an optimist about the post-war period. Apart
from some weird political theories, and notwithstanding
the Depression, the world made more progress in the 20

years after the 1914-18 war

than in the 20 vears before

it—3in art, science, production, standard of living, everything, War is destructive, but it stimulates men’s minds
for the work of reconstruction, and that stimulus is powerful and long-lasting; there is a follow-through that lifts
the world by its own bootstraps. For six years millions of
young men have been dreaming of a better world. What

can come of that but good?”
Educated in Halifax

Warning us that answers to most
questions would be brief because he
didn’t intend to write an autobiography for at least another 20 years,
Mr. Raddall proceeded to tell us
about himself. He was born (an untold number of years ago) at Hythe,
England, and at six years entered
St. Leonard’s Boys’ School there;
left at nine years when his family
moved to Halifax, N. S. Here he en
tered Chebucto School and the old,

Academy, which he left to enlist in
1918.

He became a _ wireless operator
and served on various Canadian
ships, ranging from a transport to
a 2500-ton tramp “The greater part
of the time,” said Mr. Raddall, “was
spent at sea, with such ports of call
as London, the Azores, New York,
Boston, and so on.”

Back-ground For Novels

Mr. Raddall was then asked if
writing had always been his great
ambition.

“T had a vague ambition to write,”
he said, “from the time I went to
sea, but I did nothing much about
it until I married in 1927 when I discovered that two cannot live as
cheaply as one.” (He now has two
children, a boy aged 10, and a girl,
aged 8.)

“T had become greatly interested
in the people of Queen’s County and
their story and it occurred to me

that I might satisfy my literary in- |.

stincts and at the same time earn
a little extra cash by writing for
magazines.

“For 10 years it was simply a useful hobby. By 1938 my tales in
Blackwood’s Magazine had received
such favorable comment from people
whose opinion I valued that I threw
up my job as accountant and devoted my time to writing.”

His first’ short story, a tale of
Sable Island, had been bought by
MacLean’s Magazine in 1928.

The next question was “What do
you consider your best piece of
writing,”

“My novel, ‘His Majesty’s Yankees’, fruit of ten years of research,
is my most serious piece of work.
Of my short stories I like ‘Blind
MeNair’ best.”

The next question boldly put forth
was whether the greater part of his
“fan mail’ was from men or from
women.

“My ‘fan mail’ seems to be divided
equally between men and women;
perhaps the women write more—I’m
not sure.”

“Who do you consider the three
most interesting of prominent, modern-day women A

“Madame Chiang Kai Shek, Edna
St. Vicent Millay, Katharine Hepburn—but as a personality, not as
an actress.”

“If you could meet any three people who have ever lived, whom would
you choose?”

“What a question! Well, I should
like to meet Napoleon, I suppose, because I was born in the army and
learned to walk in a barrack square,
and he was the greatest soldier ever.
And I’d like to meet Shakespeare to
see how he worked and where he
got his material. But, most of all,
I’d like to meet Jesus Christ, to feel
for myself the inspiration of his
personality. I don’t say this out of
piety, for in the ordinary sense I’m
not a bit religious; but to hold

| speech with such a man must have

been a marvellous experience.”

“Who is your most unforgettable
character ?”

“My father. He was killed while
leading the Winnipeg Rifles at Amiens in the last war.”

Getting personal, we then asked
Mr. Raddall what he considered his
outstanding characteristic.

Good, Bad Characteristics

“T suppose my outstanding characteristic is stubborness, a bad trait
in many ways, but it has carried me
over many difficulties. Apart from
that, an abiding curiosity about people and the reasons why they do the
things they do.”

“What do you consider your most
favorable charactersitic ?”

“The abiding curiosity, probably.
How should I know”

“What is your worst faul

“My worst fault I asked my wife
(who should know), but she refuses
to decide. There are so many.”

“What are your pet hates?”

“T have a number of pet hates.
Who hasn’t? I love music but hate
opera. I hate books in dialect, and
people who talk in theatres, and
spaghetti and cheese, and people
who phone when I’m writing, and
Sundays in Halifax. Quite often I
hate myself.”

“What is your favorite food?”

“My notion of the perfect dish is
lobster chowder.”

“Do you smoke?”

“IT smoke continually; pipe, cigarettes, and cigars — when I can get
them.”

“As a boy, did you like to read
very much?”

Voracious Reader

“T have been a voracious reader
from boyhood. I think I began with
‘Buffalo Bill,’ whose adventures sold
at a penny an instalment. I liked
Ballantyne, Cooper, Henty, Mayne
Reid, Marryat, Stevenson. A muchtravelled road and a geod one. I
still admire the skill with which my
father led me along it. His one mistake was Dickens, whose works
(apart from ‘A Tale of Two Cities’)
I considered—and still consider—a
lot of balderdash. Now I find Ballantyne dull, Cooper absurd, and
Henty preposterous, but Reid, Marryat and Stevenson hold their charm.

“T still consider Sherlock Holmes
the only detective worth reading
about. The modern mystery story
leaves me cold. There is too much
mystery and not enough story. I’m
aware that many people read them
because they like to puzzle their
wits; but in that case why not play
chess ?”

How about it Why not?

Glumnasium with no thumping of

Swallow, the presidential candidate, made a short speech to those
assembled. Tucking his hand beneath his denims, to keep the corsage lice from bedevilling his hide,
he boomed, “Girls, vote with me and
you will rule the campus.” His voice
went up and halted on the plane of
a maniacal laff.

A hundred and seventy-six girls
from Marmalade Hutch then swept
in, all dressed alike and distinguishable only by the fact that their faces
were uncovered, while the rest of
their bodies were swathed in rolls of
fire-silk pink.

Behind them, clumping morosely,
came the youngest Engineers, who
were singing, “When we grow up,
what won’t,we tell our grandchildren?” Right now, they strove to
overcome their adolescence and ignorance by pretending to turn a
world-wise cheek at the direction of
the gals, but the coy boys did not
succeed.

The orchestra stepped into “Clodhopper Jump”, and the girls began
to kick at the males with their
shapely hooves slasped around with
Dogpatch brogans, and Dogpatch
bobby socks bristled with nails like
a dog-collar. The majority stood not
the pain, nor waited courteously, but
trumpeted, “This hurts.” “All the
better to make you amenable,” one
gal chortled.

One lad seemed oblivious of the
pain. Asked by Mongo of the Gazoot staff if he was feeling any pain
from the kicks of his partner, he
said, out of the corner of his mouth,
*Seram, bud, I’ve been out with
college girls before.”

Newshawk Barnsmell, who is no

dashed upon the scene. “Where did
you come from?” was the cry of a
thousand voices, just to be sociable.
“Last week you plummetted to
death.”

“Twas not me,” quoath Barnsmell, “but only my psuedonym,
which went out with the decline and
fall of classics.”” The wind changed,
and a dozen husky men picked Barnsmell up by the seat of his pianofourcornered underwear and tossed
him out the door.

“Where are the boys from the old

Sloplop, who ran around with pencil
and paper. “Engineers to the fore,”
they sang. A dozen gremlins stepped forward. “The results of higher

Christianity, scholarship and rations

CONNIE ARCHIBALD

Connie needs no introduction on
Dalhousie Campus—she is known to
all here as an outstanding student,
an efficient worker, a grand girl and
an outstanding example of versatility.

Connie is a junior in Science, having come to Dal as a freshie-soph
from Truro Academy on a Regional
Scholarship.

As a freshette, Connie was awarded the Pan-Hellenie Award. She

that she’s had a lot of fun, too. Inshort, Connie has done many jobs
well.

ia

about the spirit of all those people

who do not even bother to sit on

the sidelines, but all of whom are

doing a lot of criticising. These are
the people, and particularly the latter, who have so much to say and

yet what are they doing to help the
spirit of the teams?

First of all they don’t even bother

to help a team by getting on it,

with all their superior knowledge
of how a team should work, be it

_ basketball, hockey or what have you

—(and this is intended to be sar
_eastic—because in most everything

the armchair critic knows all the

- answers—but what do they do about

it?). Secondly, either these people
do not come out to the games to
cheer their team on, or if they do,
they more than likely cheer for the
opposing team. Then when a game
is over, if Dal wins—and we have
had some good wins this year—does
the team, individually or collectively
get a hearty clap on the back...
most unlikely, but if they lose, they
are sure to hear from all sides—
“Huh, lost again, didn’t. you?”

_I have always been under the impression (and I think you will agree)
that we humans, separately or en
masse, always do a better job in any
undertaking in our work or play,
when those people who are or should
be behind us and interested in the
outcome of the job at hand, are behind us whole-heartedly. There is a
pretty good example, which we can
all see in the world news headlines
today. These people behind us must
be loyal and optimistic to the end,
and beyond the end, in view of the
next encounter. But when all or at
least most of our supposed spporters are right behind their teams
with a really defeatist attitude—
is to be expected? Why
should they fight—there isn’t really
much to fight for is there?

The Dalhousie teams have had
some tough breaks lately, but they
have played good, clean, and usually
No team
wins all the time and I would like
to point out that last year the girls’
basketball team won two of the
three intercollegiate games they
played (exhibition games, as that
is all they have for the duration).
However, the campus critics have
forgotten this and since they lost
their first intercollegiate game this
year — they are, according to the
general opinion, a losing team (in
fact, according to the Gazette of
last week, Dalhousie’s teams have
been losing for three or four weeks.)

No one has been very interested
in giving the girls a boost for having cleaned up so far—without a
loss on the eight City Leazue games,
so far played. Of course you say:
—‘Oh well, they are only High
School teams, but four of these

The president of Dalhousie Girls’
Athletic Club for two years, Anne
is one of the outstanding girl athletes of the campus. Her ability as
a basketball player is known to all
who follow girls’ sport at Dal, for
she has played as a forward on the
first team for her three years here.

Tennis is another field in which
she shines. She held the Dalhousie
Ladies’ Championship Cup in 194243. Badminton and skiing also claim
her as an enthusiast.

Anne’s interest is not totally concerned with sport. She is vice-president of Delta Gamma, past president of Pi Beta Phi, and is very

Last Friday the girls lost by one
point to Acalia and how many of
our backers (?) said “Good show,
you'll make that up on the return
game.” (?) Well, maybe they won’t,
maybe they will, but perhaps they
would have an incentive.to fight for
it on the return game if they felt
that the campus was with them.

Dal Coeds Drop

Dal co-eds lost a heart-breaking
game to the visiting Acadia team

the first half. The Acadian forwards shot accurately until they tied
and passed the Dal sextet a few
minutes before the final whistle. At
the end of the game the score stood

D.G.A.C. SPORTS IN REVIEW

Girls’ Sports got underway with
a great bang this year. In the first
term the old system of teams was
revived having only Blacks and
Golds competing in basketball and
badminton. This system suffered in
the second term due to the Varsity
Girls’ B.B. functions. However, all
girls have shown their interest in
the support and success of the
teams.

This year for the first time Dal
Girls have entered the city league
and not only has the successful
senior team, but also a_ brilliant
Intermediate Team. Many fast
games have been witnessed by the |
few Dal supporters who turn out.
Up to date Dal seems quite hopeful
of taking the league in both sections. The only losses credited to
both these teams are the games
played at Mt. A. This could be accounted for by the wearisome trip
preceding the battle. On March 3rd
at Dal, we hope to regain our glory.
The first team lost a heart-breaking
game to Acadia. Even though
Acagig won by one point, we feel

Archery has had a very successful

classes now instead of one. There

was an arching contest with Peregrine which unfortunately Dal lost.
This was probably due to the change

exciting and remained undecided
until a few minutes before the end.
