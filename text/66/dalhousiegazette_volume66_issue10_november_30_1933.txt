The conference is not so much a
conference for the S.C. M. executives
as it is an opportunity for any student
who so desires to have the wonderful

en experience of participating in such a

. gathering.
z One question—the supreme question
of religion—is in the minds of all
thoughtful students today, namely,
‘Is there a God in whom I must believe, and how can I find Him?’
oer This i is the question which the leaders
a 5 of ‘the Conference will seek to answer.

e. ‘For many today God has faded out

and become a “vague oblong blur’, and

ens with the fading out of God has come
uncertainty and restlessness.
. ‘In his latest book, ‘‘How can I Find
God?” Leslie Weatherhead says, ‘‘Finding God means entering into a persona!
conscious communion, spirit with spirit, ;
with one recognized to be a fitting

a object of worship and love, in whom

Ne we find forgiveness of sin, whose will

x‘, we desire to do, in whom all our highest
values are conserved.”
“Finding God is having with you

+ a great Comrade Who redeems every

or. part of life, keeps you from some
dangers and makes you able to face

Na circumstances which, without His pres
ac ~ cence, would be meaningless and dull.”
ie? How Jesus proves Himself to be the
way to the Father. How He provides

the power to enable us to live a life

victorious over temptation. How he

sends us forth into the chaos of our

, economic, political and social life

f with principles and a method which

will transform them. ;
These are some of the issues which
will be faced and discussed in the
intimacy of a real fellowship at Pine
Hill from Dec. 28 to Jan. 2nd.

Leaders.

While the leaders of the conference

cannot be definitely announced, Mur

HALIFAX, NOVA SCOTIA, NOVEMBER 30th, 1988.

 

 

Dalhousie University has suffered
a great loss in the death of Mr. W. H.
Cnase, who was one of the Board of
Governors. His life and career ought
to be an example to the young men of
this Province. It is often said that the
community suffers a loss in the aeath
of a famous citizen. This is peculiarly
true of the death of Mr. Chase. One
of the comn.onest topics of conversation, remarked by visitors and newcomers to this Province, is the great
time of prosperity which the Province
once enjoyed, when lumbering, snipbuilding, and the carrying trade, were
at their height. And in these conversations there is always an undertone
of suggestion that opportunities for
prosperity to the community, or for a
career to the individual, no longer
exist. I am not aware that the late
Mr. Chase ever spoke on this thesis,
but his whole life was a most vigorous
denial of it. Not only did he do things
on a great scale himself, and become
master of a large fortune, he nourished
a new industry, opened up new channels of trade,

and encouraged scores;

and hundreds of his fellow citizens to

believe in the resources of this Province,
and in themselves,

This was a great achievement, but
Mr. Chase did more. He lived quietly
and simply in the community in which
he had acquired his wealth, interesting
himself in good cause which
came under his notice. Though he
had much to think of and to be occupied with in his own affairs, he seemed
always never to think of himself but
to be interested in the occupations and
projects of other men—particularly if
these projects were public enterprises.
The manner in which he gave his great
present to the people of this Province,
namely, the Archives Building, which
stands on the grounds of Dalhousie
University, characteristic. He
gave it anonymously, and asked that
his name be not associated with the
building. Yet the Nova “Scotia Archives Building is a monument such as
few millionaires leave behind them.

Mr. Chase will always be remembered as a good citizen, and as an example
of the qualities of citizenship.

Delta Gamma
Tea Dance

To the Editors of Dalhousie Gazette.

Sirs:

I think that it cannot be said of me
that I have ever knowingiy over
estimated the value of womien in the
present-day circles of society.

This attitude, be it narrow and
bigotted, fair or unfair, holds true for
a goodly representation of that portion
of our species differentiated as male
but even those of us with the most antifeminine tendencies will not but sense
to a small degree at least, the colossal
unfairness of the report which appeared in the last issue of this periodical,
of the Delta Gamma Dance at Shirreff
Hall.

The tea-dance, I understand, was an
effort and a splendid one, on the part
of Delta Gamma to contribute to the
Community Chest fund, which in
itself needs no eulogy.

To my knowledge, every one present,
especially those invited, were highly
delightea with the pleasant informality
of the gathering, the refreshments
served, and the music and dancing,
and in my belief, it is only a “piker’’,
to use current phraseology, who would
demana more for only the trouble of
coming to the dance.

Although not given to looking gift
horses in the mouth, I may say that
the whole affair was well organized
and he who could deem himself fair
in giving to the Gazette a write-up of
that character, was indeea one of two
things,—He was either not sufficiently
fortunate to have been invited, oc
| casioning thereby the unfair and mean

statements based on no facts whatsoiever; or else he is the embodiment of
insincerity; for given the same facilltties, he could not have organized as
pleasant an afternoon as the one at
Shirreff Hall.

My only point in submitting this
protest, is in fairness to the rest of the
gentic men who were present and enjoyed themselves.

J thank you for the necessary space.

Yours truly,
H. MacNASTY.

Freshmen Win
Bennett Debate

The Freshman were successful in
disproving the resolution that ‘“ Modern
Advertising is detrimental to the interests of the General Public.’’ Mr.
Mercer, leader, and Miss Drummie,
who seconded him, were the very capable representatives of the Freshman
class. Mr. Burchell, leader, ana Miss
Kerr who seconded were the representatives of the Sophomore Class.
They upheld the affirmative. This
debate was the first round in the
Bennett Shield Contest.

Mr. Mercer and his seconder, Miss
Drummie brought out the facts that
advertising, (1) lowers cost of products,
(2) raises standards of living, (8) benefits education, (4) provides for entertainment, (5) benefits products advertised, (6) should benefit the Maritimes.
They pointed out that beautiful summer resorts of the Maritimes are unknown because the Maritimes can’t
be bothered telling the world what
they have to offer. Radio, which has
been condemned because it is used too
much as a means for advertising was
a gift of commerce to the world. The
Freshman team claimed that Pharos
would cost $10.00 per copy without
advertising space and the daily newspaper would cost 1.50. An interesting
fact which was brought to attention
was that even"the church advertises—
“Come Unto Me.”

The sophomore team in championing
the affirmative brought out some
very interesting facts about the lack
of scruple in the wording and implications of advertising. Many in the
audience were greatly disappointed—
almost chagrined to find out that
Listerine does not cure halitosis. Just
think about the last time you went to
see your best girl—confident that you
had ridden yourself of the enemy
“hally’—and now you learn that
he wasn’t even harmed! Be nonchalant m’lad. Then imagine the girl who
has been using ambrosia to make her
skin ‘‘soft and velvety; free from those
heartless wrinkles—age.’’ Now she
learns that her one hope, her one way
to youth, contains a skin irritant.
They pointed out that gaudy sigrs
were a menace; cars today are cheaper,
but they don’t go so well and that
instalment buying creates a want which
tries to satisfy but does not.’’ ‘‘Producers in market to produce a gain

Address Made To

Students

Mr. A. Hanfield Whitman, President
of Robin, Jones and Whitman spoke
to the Commerce students on Thursday last, at their regular meeting place,
64 Edward St., on the subject of
“dried fish.’’ He thoroughly explained
all phases of this great Nova Scotian
industry. The present depression in
dried fish industry is the result. of
factors which Mr. Whitman traced
back for several years, The people
of this generation do not eat as much
salt fish as was the custom in his time.
He continued to say that the chief
consuming countries were the Latin
countries, particularly Spain, Italy,
Portugal and Brazil. Canada and
Newfoundland had suffered much as
a result of Iceland’s recent attempts
to capture the principal European
market. There is as much Fish consumed to day as there was in 1928,
but there is such a supply on the market that prices are forced down to an
unproductive level in the effort to sell.
The financing of fish sales to a country
like Brazil these days is very difficult
and requires constant vigilance declared the speaker. The dried fish
industry has been and still is one of
Nova Scotia’s basic trades. Nova
Scotia is feeling acutely the competi

Writer Airs View

On Peace Aims

The Editor,
Dalhousie Gazette.

Dear Sir:—

I was much interested in the reprint
of the editorial appearing in the
Gazette, way back in 1916. I believe the
person who wrote it was sincere—but
mistaken.

It is a noble thing to be ready to die
for one’s country and for one’s King
but it is my conviction that one’s life
would be lost with infinitely more benefit to King and Country if he were shot
with his back to the wall for refusing to
fight, than if it were lost in winning the
deciding victory on the field of battle.

If man desires that strife and disharmony should cease, and if he be a
realist, there is no cther course open
for him than to adopt a spirit of good
will toward his fellowmen regardless
of color, creed, or class. Man cannot
love his enemy and kill him at the same
time, at least I can’t conceive of recognizing love by such fruits; by love
I mean merely good will. If one regards human life as being of supreme
value, can one morally support a conflict that threatens to destroy countless
lives?

War is not inevitable. There are
some recent primitive peoples whose
vocabularies boast of no word corresponding to ‘‘war’’. War is initiated
and carried on by an artificial and
deliberate stimulation of a war frame
of mind by promoters. I maintain
the way out of war is either to do away
with this deliberate sowing of the seeds
of conflict by war promoters, or if that
cannot be done, then we who do not
desire war must just as deliberately
and systematically stimulate that frame
of mind that will seek peace at any cost.
We must cultivate a world psychology
that is untavorable to conflict. If we
are to do this task in the interests of
human welfare we must renounce the
method of wholesale murder in settling
international and civil disputes. We
must be willing to promote peace by
practicing peace.

It is a shame and a dishonor to
christian nations that they should be
carried by amtbitious dreams of advantage and greed, so far beyond the
bounds of reason and brotherhood, into
a lust for blood and revenge of fictitious
wrongs.

Yours in the cause of peace,

A. W. MUTCH.

THE COLLEGE TERM.

With the present issue, the Gazette suspends publication
until next term. With the prospects of sessiona] examinations now
suflicient of a reality to evoke some uneasy activity from the great
majority of us, the Gazette editors are not unwilling to lay aside
their journalistic—which may be questioned—duties, and to make
as full use of their time in an academic direction. Despite the
lateness of the term, it is by no means too late as yet for those who
have neglected their work to get in some heavy plugging and

struggle through the mid-term tests.

The term now drawing to a close has been marked with few
untoward incidents, and as a matter of fact has been somewhat
colorless, but at the same time it is probable that there has been
a slackening of the feverish pace of social events this year as com
pared with that of former years, and a corresponding quickening
of interest in matters concerned with the real purpose of a “‘college

- publication of the Gazette which their critics necessarily do not,
ave been content to let such criticism and such righteous protest
pass without comment. The Gazette is probably no better a
paper. and perhaps worse, than it always has been. But the
Gazette this year has never been actuated by a spirit of malice at
any time, and if harm was done, none was ever intended. To be
true, the editors have been more than inclined not to stress the
so-called “big shots’’ of the campus, and will continue with that
policy. They have refused to print the usual unadulterated nonsense praising a college show just because it is a college show regardless of its merits or faults, and will continue with that policy. In
short, they have been free with their criticism, and with their
. praise, where criticism and praise were deserved, and will continue
with that policy. And at all times to strive towards the constructive betterment of Dalhousie.

 

 

The Innocent Bystander

 

for studying is not present. The desire for fresh air to avoid an overstudied condition. The realization
that studying at the moment is out of
the question. The desire for mental
stimulation induced by a show. The
hurried departure. The gnawings of
conscience. Repeat process ad infinitum,

A student, having make ze dance ali

Our Glee Club, we have been given
to understand, is a bit touchy about
being criticised; all true Delta Gammas
bristle with the righteous indignation
of outraged womanhood at the least
slight at Shirreff Hall; the Council is
distinctly annoyed if its acts are
questioned; the teams demand the
unstinted praise and support of the
entire student body which for its part
viciously snarls if its name be mentioned by the Campus Commentator,
yet one and all come down week after
week with scorn, aisgust and criticism
on the poor little ‘‘Gazette,”” which
struggles pitifully along its arduous
way, feeaing, as the stork feeds its

DALHOUSIE GAZETTE

The Girls Get Together

 

Editor of The Knocker’s Corner,
Dalhousie Gazette.
Dear Sir:—

The indignation and wrath with
which your report cf the Delta Gamma
Tea Dance has been read leaves cne
speechless and amazed that any one
could write such drivel and still have
the nerve to walk abroad.

To deviate from the subject for a
moment, may J ask just what yeour
paper is functioning for? Your enthusiasm for college activities is overwhelming.. You praise nothing and
condemn everything. Is that any
way to encourage students to be upand
doing? Does anyone, more particularly a young person, wish to take part
in any activity knowing for a certainty
that whatever they have done will be
unmercifully criticized with not a word
of praise thrown in? Perhaps your
idea is that criticism is good for the
welfare of the soul. Thank goodness
there are a few people who disagree
with you.

Returning to the question of the
Delta Gamma Tea Dance there seems
to be some question as to whether
you know what you are talking about
or not. If you were present your
audacity is amazing and you are
deserving of nothing better than a
lynching. If you were not present

you had no business to say the things

The egoism of the conceited male
is also very vividly portrayed in your
words, ‘‘On the few occasions
when the Dear Girls entertain.”” Did
you for one minute think that our
little party was put on for the special
benefit of the *‘men’’? If so it is time
you were corrected. We had to raise
money and we wished to do so by
dancing so we asked a few ‘‘men’”’ to
help us with our project. We honored
you with invitations and look at the
result. Shame!

Before closing may I say that the
floor was quite large enough to accommodate all the dancers and that the
chairs were sufficient in number to
seat everyone.

There was one statement which you
made which is very worthy of mention
“Saturday’s ten was a fine
example.”” And that is exactly what
it was; a fine example of the way the
girls do things when once they have
decided. We decitled to raise money
for the community chest and we
went ahead and did it without any
hesitation.

However due to the fact that you
seem to be expressing the consensus
of opinion of the male population we
feel that it would be absolutely useless
to stage our annual dance as of course

Basketball
et eons Opens
ee 20

Coach Jack Thomas has decided that
it is time to whip the boys into shape
for a big basketball season. The
Halifax City League will start about
January 20 with Dal taking on the
Wanderers, and the “Y”’ tackling
Acadia the following Tuesdav. Practices will be held on Mondays and
Wednesdays until examination week
each dav during the Christmas vacation, and every day after Christmas.
This year Jack plans to use a snappy
five man attack combined with a closechecking man-to-man defence. To use
this style on the large Dalhousie floor,
top notch condition is imperative so
the coach and Manager Don Stewart
plan to lay down training rules, tne
violation of which will cost the offender his jersey. The boys will be disappointed leaving the BoilermakerMillionaires Ball at 11.30, but witn the
initial league game the next day, it
must be done. With the Dominion
playdowns coming East this year perhaps the Tigers have their eyes on
the championship. The Cubs will
have their hands full defending their
City League crown in a seven team
Intermediate League that will supply
plenty of heads-up basketball.

The hoopsters called for the initia]
practices are: Charlie Anderson, Don
Bauid, Doug and Ted Crease, Ben
DuBitier, Sam Fairstein. Harry Gaum,
Bill Gladstone, Leo Green, Chuck
Lorway, Abe Mandelstan, Mil Musgrave, Cy Miller, Roy MacDonald,
Bernie Ralston, Sam Rosner, Leo Simmonds, S. Shenfold, Bord Stoddard,
Ken Sullivan.

In the event of a City Junior League

being formed those basketballers not |

mentioned above will be asked to turn
out for the Dalhousie Junior entry.

Changes may be made in this
tentative squad if some of the boys
‘““graduate’”’ at Christmas, or the Pres-dent asks them not to play.

 

Hockey Prospects

P. T. Classes are being held regularly
for the Hockey Candidates. Mr. Stirling is conducting the classes which are
held every Tues., Thurs. and Sat. at
12 o'clock. Both Herbie Grant, manager and Potter Oyler, coach are pleased with the turnouts.

Among those turning out Saturday

were, Roger Rowley of Ashbury School,
Ont., Bruce Fergusson of the Port
Morien Aces, Ed. Stewart and Eddie
Cohn, H. C. A. Products; Jim Crosby,
of R. C. S. and Kings, Doug Bent,
who has played Dal Senior last two
years, Herbie Grant, playing-manager,
formerly of Mt. A.; Bob Stanfield of
Ashbury School and member of last
year’s squad, Sandy MacPherson, of
Sask. Intermed. League, Harold Flynn,
St. F. X. played in A. P. C. league for
2 years, Russell Bryant of Sussex and
last year’s squad, Don Christie of
Truro, Cappy Cook of Sydney Miliionaires and last year’s squad, and Don
Cameron, common school product.

Others intending to turn out are
Biscay Ellis, Art Smith, Hal Connor
of last year’s squad, Jim Pistone, Jack
Buckley former star, Dave Foquier of
Ashbury and many others. Prospects
for a good team are bright and lots of
enthusiasm is being displayed.

The league is producing some good
baskethall but the poor condition of
the players is evident. There is in
some cases a decided lack of teamwork
but in this respect the teams are equal.
Each squad has three games remaininp
so anyone can wir. Bernie Ralston is
an outstanding hoopster, being largely
responsible for Crease’s team being
in first place. Gladstone of Sullivan's

Girls’ Basketball

This year’s freshman class promises
to furnish good material for the basketball team. There are many players
how have the necessary speed and
accuracy. Isabel Fraser is doing very
well asjumiping center. Shirley Sterns
has good speed and precision in shooting. Charlotte Stuart is very quick in
breaking up passes.

Charlie Anderson has been working
up the speed and accuracy of the piavers. Concentration has been put on
shooting and passing. Practices are
held Tuesdav, Thursdav and Saturdav.
There will be no more practices untii
after Christmas after the 28th., because of examinations.

Varsity.

The MacDonald Library is not just
the place that a ‘‘thinking student’’
would select tor a snooze, yet they
do manage somehow to find the environment conducive to slumber. Every day, by increasing numbers they
haunt the place. Even the call of the
class bell does not interrupt the rhythmical rise and fall of the newspaper
covering the slumberer’s proboscis
as he continues in ‘‘the season ofall
natures, sleep.’’ Most colleges are not
however immune from having somnolent readers make use of their libraries.
The Varsity reports that the Library
Committee of Hart House held a meeting to talk of library sleepers; **but,”’
says one of the committee, “‘although
I was unable to attend the last meeting
I feel sure that no action will be taken
against students found asleep.” However he emphasized the fact that
snoring would not be tolerated under
the ‘‘silence”’ rule.

We Can Do Our Part! - - - 
The Exams will soon be here.

Don’t you really think that a few

new accessories such as a tie, spats, and hat would make you look as successful as you are bound to feel when you greet the family with that famous

phrase, ‘‘I got through.”
