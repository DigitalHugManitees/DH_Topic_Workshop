Art’s building. The society discussed the coming Maritime Intercollegiate Debating League conference. Donald Cross an active
debater and secretary of the society

The main business of the conference will be the following questions; whether or not the Maritimes
should enter a Dominion League?
How will the Maritime team be

a s : ee gr a Dominion debate ?

 

Warner Broadcasts On
Trans-Canada Network

Opportunity Knocked and Don Warner, former Dal law student,
opened the door Wednesday evening at 9:30 p.m. Warner was heard
on the Canadian network from coast to coast last Wednesday evening

when he performed on John Adaskin’s talent show,

Knocks.”

Warner’s successful career in

“Opportunity

Halifax is well known to Haligo
nians and Dalhousians alike, who were entertained by both his Sextet

and 15 piece orchestra.

Taking the last guest spot on the programme, Warner successfully ended the programme with a vocal chorus of “Shine” and
“Lazybones,” accompanying the former with a trumpet golo. His selfstyled jazz singing was the hit of the evening.

While attending Dalhousie Law school Warner gained campus
prominence with his band at the many social events and dances held
at the University. Haligonians will remember him’as the maestro who
supplied the Nova Scotian supper dances with strains of melodious

harmony.on Saturday nights.

“Glory, Glory to Dalhousie’.
That song might well be the provincial anthem of Canada’s tenth province, provided Newfoundland ever becomes

our tenth province.

When the plane carrying the Newfoundland detewation
arrived in Ottawa, where the confederation talks have been
held, it looked lik “Old Home Week” for Dalhousie, accordor to one well-known newspaperwoman.

 

Cull Elected
Engineering
President

Dalhousie’s Engineering Society
held its first meeting yesterday
for the appointment of officers for
the 1948—49 term. Bert Cull, well
known football player, was elected
President of the Society, while
John Lindsay was elected to the
post of Secretary-Treasurer.

One of the main points of discussion at the meeting was the annual Engineer’s trip to one of
Nova Scotia’s industrial centres,
but as yet nothing has been definitely decided. The meeting also
dealt with the question of the finances of the Engineering canteen,
which is now open for the sale of
cigarettes, cokes and _ chocolate
bars,

The meeting was informed that
there is now a memorial picture
of Professor Copp, a late lecturer
at Dalhousie, hanging in the lounge
as a tribute to his popularity.

Various other officers were elected at the meeting, among them
the team managers and the Gazette reporter.

ere Vincent e.

MacDonald, Dean of
Dalhousie Law School, and a gold
medallist, who graduated from Dal
is advisor to the Newfoundland delegation,

Heading the delegation is Hon.
J. A. Walsh, K.C., LL.B., a Dal
grad and gold medallist.

Phillip Gruchy, CBE, vice-president of the Newfoundland newsprint company at Grand Falls is
also a gold medallist graduate as
is John B. McEvoy, K.C., LL.B.
Two other Dal grads who are well
known in Ottawa are F. Gordon
Bradley, K.C., LL.B., and H. G.
Pudester, one of the official advisors. Another is Gordon A, Winters.

On hand to meet the delegation
were Hon, C, J. Burchill, Canadian
High Commissioner to Newfoundland and graduate and former lecturer of Dalhousie Law School, and
Dr. A. R. MacKay, outstanding
former faculty member at Dalhousie, who now holds an important position in the Department of
External Affairs in Ottawa. Dr.
MacKay was professor of Political

“Progressive-Conservatives Take Definite

Stand Against Communism” States Bill Cox
By Valerie Cato

“The Progressive-Conservative
party takes a definite stand against
Communism,” said Bill Cox at a
meeting held by that party on
Wednesday evening. He went on
to add that no other group has
expressed itself so strongly on the
question, citing as examples both
the Liberals and C.C.F.

The National Convention of the
Progressive-Conservative party,
which was held from Sept. 30th to
Oct. 2nd, was a fine sample of
spontaneity and freedom of speech.
It had none of the rehearsed atmosphere of other conventions, and
at informal meetings was more
like a college pep rally than a
serious politician’s gathering.

The term Progressive-Conservative is not, as one might think, a
contradiction in terms. The party
is conservative in that it holds
steadfastly to certain fundamental
principals in the government of the

g | country. But it is also progressive
‘because sees the need of certain

reforms if the nation will advance
with the rest of the world. There
were several industries established
in the last Conservative government, among them Imperial Oil,
which has been an Invaluable asset
to the Maritimes.

The election of George Drew as
head of the party was really only
the climax of what most people
had regarded as a certainty from
the beginning. Drew was the ideal
man for the job. Although the
others were admired for certain
characteristics, it was Drew alone
who had the real ability.

Although Drew is a _ native
Torontonian, it was not from there
that he got his votes. In fact, his
party lost three seats there. His
list of achievements for Ontario is
a long one. Because of his efforts,
Ontario now has the best educational facilities in Canada. The
provincial government takes up to
50% of the cost of education and

in the very small places, even as

.
li
i. \ wey Rate
ee eee Gi i Ss, ee ee

high as 95%. He brought to Ontario 25,000 skilled immigrants
and instigated an air immigration
scheme which he was forced to
abandon, owing to the lack of cooperation of the Canadian government,

According to Mr. Cox, who had
the opportunity of talking to him
for over three hours, Drew is an
excellent man. He is easy to talk
to, although a little shy. As most
of us know, he is very good looking. As a matter of fact, the only
objections his opponents have to
him are that he is handsome and a
native of Toronto. At the convention, about 80% of the men were
under 45, and with Drew to lead it,
the party stands a good chance of
being reorganized with vigorous
and enthusiastic members.

The platform upon which the
Progressive Conserviatives hope to
win the next election is.a long and
varied one, ranging from free enterprise to the adoption of a na
|

tional flag as soon as_ possible.
Although what he said about the
various resolutions was, of necessity, quite brief, Mr. Cox wanted it
understood that many, in fact,
most of the resolutions adopted
were to the point, not just general
ideas.

The resolution committee, which
met two days before the Convention, encountered little difficulty
with the majority of the plans submitted to them. Any objections to
them were given a hearing. Several
ideas for the Maritimes came up,
and certain of them were given a
separate section. No decision was
reached on the freight rates question, but it was suggested that the
situation be looked into.

“The Progressive Conservative
party is no longer going to be
everybody’s friend, but will take
such steps as will gain it steadfast
friends and some enemies,” was the
final point made by Mr. Cox.

WAR MEMORIALS

a | At this time of Thanksgiving it might not be out of place
_ to recall the glowing reports of the form which our war

“memorial was to take in 1945. It was generally agreed that
more plaques would not do; that something more lasting, substantial and useful was needed. The student forums recommended students’ unions, residences and swimming pools.
Rees, The matter assumed proportions of such importance that
_ it was placed on the ballot for the Council elections in 1946.
The students voted down a swimming pool or a rink, and
chose a residence as the War Memorial Dalhousie should
- build. The result was announced with great-eclat, and then
he students, feeling that they had done their duty in inicating a preference, forgot all about it, and so the matter

| So THE EMPLOYMENT SERVICE
Peg leh Ae hain of student employment has been a moot
_ point around Dalhousie for some time. The University pur
>

ih ported to have an agency which would place graduating stu
_ dents and, in some cases, find summer positions for under_ graduates. This, however, was always rather uncertain; if an
employer asked the University to find men for him, a notice

Bi was put up to that affect. It never amounted to much more.
RAE i NES °. ;

  

        
  
   
 
 
   
  
  

The Vets’ Association had an excellent bureau for a cou
_ ple of years, and the present Personal Services began as the
_ private enterprise of a couple of law students. These were
_ adequate for veterans, but were not intended to be a general

agency through which any student could find a job. The
Council supplied such an agency this summer in the Personal

Services, now operated by them. Now, a student can get a
job of some sort at any time. Indications are that this organization will eventually take over the placing of graduates in
---- positions as well.

THE CLOCK PICTURE

___ Last week the Gazette received a letter from Professor
‘Theakston’s office which, among other things, pointed out
that the cut which the Gazette ran of the new time clock in
the Gym was of a clock of a totally different design to ours.

_ Checking back to discover the origin of the cut, it was
discovered that it was received late last year from the
_. Players Advertising department, as the type of clock which
___-we could expect. With a limited budget for cuts, in any case,
____ the Gazette could probably not afford a new one of the clock.

For the benefit of those who feel that they were de_ eeived by the picture, be it known that anybody can-see the
Ans actual, real and genuine clock by going into the Gym and
asking the caretaker there to point out the article, which he

_ will be only too pleased to do.

Wednesday, Oct. 13—-Up betimes,
much displeased that President
Otto has sent me, indirectly, a
communication of his displeasure
with my diary. I resolved last night
that I would in all things try to
displease him, but as I have learned this morning that he has the
ear of the Governors, I shall try
to be pleasant toward him, although
it is a hard thing.

Visited the Gym Inn where I did
meet Willsdaughter, and we discussed the recent competition with
the redmen from the central Canadian colony. He did tell me much
of the celebrations following the
contest, saying that the indians
truly went on their ceremonial
warpath. Much said of activities in
organizations frequented by Greek
tradesmen, with braves’ Birch,
Greenwood, Young and Paul Wilson having a rare time. Most highly
exhilarated was Chief William
Davies, whose famous last words,
it is said, were; ‘““Neber hab such a
wodderful tibe.” He did recline in
a sitting position through the
night, in a tepee on South Street.

Joining me later was Malcolm
Rooster-Gale, speaker of the house
of reaction, who did tell me much
of the old game of English rugger,
played by gentlemen, he says, and
I remarked wittily that it was indeed most gentle and sweet game,
and pretty, too, as my wife has
said, with the men wearing little
pants.

Here we spent the day, observing with some distaste, the sickening affection of the athlete Shroud
Windward, and a young lady come
lately to the college on the hill,
who enjoys Christmas mightily.

We drank a great deal of wine, I
too much, and Mr. Rooster-Gale,
from Hanstport, till he could hardly
go. So home and to bed, leaving
my companion in a ditch, which reminded him of Hantsport, he said,
it being mighty muddy.

Thursday, Oct. 14 — Did hear
great alarums this morning of a
dastardly plan. Persons at the
Lady Hamilton, where I had my
morning draught, said that a group
of three insurgents had planned out
to “do in” a dog, named “Petah’,
property of a professor on the hill,
called, jokingly, Burning Martini.
The day had been set, they said,
and the little brown beast would be
hanged by the neck, with a great
rope, on the flagpole mast at the

“| college on the hill. They have sent

him a warning that if they do not
pass their examinations, they will
carry out the plot.

Did chide them for their seeming
childishness, at which one did say
they are serious.

My wife and I this morning to
the Paynter’s, and there she sat the
last time, and I stood by and did
tell them some little things to do,
that now her picture will please me
very well, and after her, a little
black dogg sat mn her lap and was
drawn, which made us very merry.

My greatest trouble, I do see, is,
that I have for this last half year
been a very great spendthrift in all
manner of respects, that I am
though I hope I am worth waht I
afeard to cast up my accounts,
think. I have newly taken a solemn
oath about abstaining from dancing parties, and wine, which I am
resolved to keep according to the
letter of the oath which I keep by
me,

Friday, Oct. 15 — Waking this:

morning out of my sleep, I did
with my elbow hit my wife a great
blow over her face and nose, which
waked her with pain, at which I
was sorry, and so to sleep again.
Did hear today that communications ith Marmalade Hovel, where
live the ladies, etc., of the college

Med Notes

During the past school year it

 

‘was noted, by many students and

without doubt by members of the
faculty, that many who used the
Medical and Dental Library really
misused it. Certain students turned sections of the library into a

virtual pig pen, This general at-|

mosphere along with other major
incidents probably prompted the
strict rulings recently imposed by
the Library Committee. We, the
students, now see the error of our
ways and are now certainly ready
to. co-operate with the Library
committee. For those who wish to
study there, the Library should be
open, during the hours they wish to
study. Where is our Medical Society executive? What are they
doing to further the dire need of
the students? Thus far we have
been unable to get into the library
at night. However, we understand
that Jack Quigley knows all about
library keys.

We would like to take this opportunity to commend the executive of the Medical Society for the
excellent program they have outlined. We do hope they have the
“wim, wigor, and witality” with
which to carry their dreams to
reality and wish them every success. We are very pleased, indeed,
to learn that Dick Groom has already procured several good films

and speakers for our meetings this

winter.

This column extends a sincere
welcome to Caroline Coghill
(Queens) and Cliff Hopmans. (Toronto) who have joined the third
year class. We understand that
Miss Coghill adds greatly to the
visual comfort of that class.

We are looking forward to the
proposed softball game between
the two fraternities. It should
prove to be an interesting game
and we hope to present the highlights to our readers.

Considerable excitement has been
caused by two elderly members of
the second year class namely,
Femur and Merryman desperately
trying to regain their lost youth by
violently robbing some of the local
eradles. Do be careful boys!

Dal Dance Band Reorganizes

  

 

By BOB MacDOUGALL

Awake Dalhousians, the spirit of
music is running amok again at
Dalhousie. Since our own Don
Warner left Halifax many and

loud have been the moans heard
around Dal. Warner, now struggling in the musical wilderness of
Toronto, created a never-to-beforgotten band at Dal. Stepping up
to capably fill his shoes now is
Les Single, sax star of the old
band. The new band is being reorganized around a necleus of
former members and it is intended
that many novelties will be featured, the band being well endowed with wits of this-type. Novelties are being assembled by Bob
Smith, a jokesmith of note.

Les Single, the leader, is a very
accomplished musician, having had
wide experience around Montreal,
his home town, and in Halifax. Les
plays tenor sax and a super clarinet. Vocals will be handled by

Maynard Taylor with novelties by
Bob Smith and Clive Shaeffer.
Something new will be added in the
person of a female vocalist, tryouts

‘for which are being held.

Dalhousians will look forward to
the debut of this new combination
which is to be at the first Student
Council Dance, Oct. 22 (night before the annual trip to Acadia).
Something new in arrangements is
being promised by pianist Joe
Poirier. Notable is the fact that the
orchestra is concentrating primarily in filling the musical needs of
the college. Bookings can be arranged by contacting Les Single at
38-2233. The new line-up will be:
Trumpets Archie Croll, Don Ritchie,, Bill MacDonald; Trombones;
Clive Shaeffer, Johnny Bustin;
Saxes: Les Single, Bob Rankine,
Ernie Heighton, Lloyd Peach, Ted.
Rowntree; Guitar: Dean Naugler;
Drums: Gerry Peckham; Piano:
Joe Poirier.

droll, and funny, too.

Did hear much that the International Students Service, which is
ever prodding and pushing on the

article in the Spectator (old version) which said that student contributions had paid for a trip to
the Old World for two students,
which they say is not true. The
money, they said, was raised by a
special contribution, — but as one
remarked—it still had to be subtracted from the whole total of the
funds, didn’t it?

Campus Roundup

by Windy O'Neill

 

For the second week in a row, the weatherman played tricks
on the Dal Tigers. Rain spoiled both the opening of the League,
a week ago, and a potentially great game against the McGill Intermediate Redmen. Even so, there were thrills galore for the
thousand odd fans who braved the uncertain weather at the Wanderer’s Grounds,

* * *

The Dal team put on a superb show against the highly rated
Montreal team, playing a tremendous defensive game, featured by the
_tackling of Paul Lee and Don Woodward. The latter seems to have
really found himself on switching from quarter to end — in our
opinion there isn’t a better end in the league.

* % *
Big Bob MacDonald was the most outstanding man on the
field. His determined plunging from his position of second man on
the end yun shook the Molson’s out of the Montreal tacklers — it

was he who made the runs that set up Dal’s touchdown.
* * &

Regardless of what the ubiquitous Halifax wet-blankets may say,
the team sent to play Dalhousie was the second best that McGill
could muster. Coach Davies of the Montreal team said that, in many
cases, the cutting from the first team to the second was done by a

flip of a coin.
* * *

Bussiere, a sweet triple-threat man and outstanding for the
Reds, was the last man cut from the Senior squad, Al Cagney,
the 200 Ib. end was coach of last year’s McGill Meteors.

ok * *
Shorty Fairhead quarterbacked two games for the Senior squad
this year. Dawson Tilley and Ron Wilson who, also, were standouts
on Saturday spent the early part of the season with the McGill first

- team.
* * 1”

The Redmen showed a well-drilled, experienced team which
might have given the Tigers a real football lesson on a dry field.
However, the Tigers found the wet field very much to their liking and played a superb game, fighting all the way, growing
stronger every minute, after getting over their early-game jitters.

* * *

A fumble, in the first two minutes of play on the McGill 20 yd.
line cost Dal a touchdown that could have caused an upset. The Tigers
also had some bad luck on a faulty decision by the officials (who
otherwise handled the game excellently) which set up the Redmens’
second touchdown. Dal tried a quick kick on the second down, the ball
hit a Tiger line-man, bounded over the line and was recovered. The
referee gave the ball to McGill on our 10 yard line, and they scored

a touchdown shortly after.
a * * *

By the rules, Dal should have been given a penalty and a loss
of the down, which would give them the third down and the Tigers could’kick out of danger.

* * *

Anyway, we learned a lot of football and found where our weak- |
nesses are, The most sadly lacking thing is adequate plays. Most of
our plays are obsolete — the end run is the only play that is really
dangerous to cause the opponents any concern. If the Tigers are going
to beat the Navy, there will have to be some hipper-dipper added—
stealing a few of the McGill plays would help.

* * *

The Tiger’s tackling is excellent but the blocking leaves much
to be desired. If we had not played a team the calibre of McGill,
these things might have remainéd dormant but against the Redmen, they stood out like Jane Russell.

* * *

Burkhart’s Boys have a week to cover these rough spots and it
should be a classy, confident team that takes the field against the
powerful Navy squad, for what will no doubt prove to be the game of
the year in the HFCL.

* * *

The McGill boys went home talking to themselves about
Maritime hospitality and the good time they were shown. We
may have lost a little money because of the main but what we
gained in good will and publicity can’t be bought.

* * *
NOTES: LIEUT. JOHNNY WATERS, one of the officials, made
a fine gesture by turning over his fee to the War Memorial Fund.
MAYOR GEE-AHERN came through magnificently giving the boys
a box of chocolates each, bi-centenial pennants, and literature of our
fair city. He also offered the Montreal boys a personally conducted

tour of the city.
* * *

In order that the McGill team could stay over, some MeGill
alums led by MR. HARRY MCKEEN, MAYOR AHERN and the
Dal Student’s Council chipped in to defray the expenses. Dynamo
JACK BOUDREAU did a great job on publicity in spite adverse
circumstances. DON BUSSIERE, a first year McGill med student
said he would like to see Dal play a return game in Montreal—
we're told its not out of the question.

* * *

Last year there were seven regulars on the Western Champion
aggregation attending that Medical School — it’s been a long time
since we’ve had representation on varsity teams from the Dal school.
St. Joseph’s up in New Brunswick have a Canadian football team and
have expressed the desire of playing a Dal Intermediate team on
their home grounds.

Rugger Team
Suffers Defeat

Oid Riva! Hand Tigers
First Defeat of Season

Amid mud and slime the Dal English Rugger team suffered its first defeat in two years, at the hands of their old
rivals, Acadia, by a score of 6-0. The game was played at|
the Wanderers Grounds last Wednesday, on a field that had |
been soaked by two days’ rain. The Tigers, last year’s provincial intermediate champions, lacked that scoring punch
and initial drive that would have brought them sure victory. The team played hard throughout and were on Acadia’s goal line on four different occasions, but were unable

‘Tournament
To Be Held

The Dalhousie annual golf tournament will be held this afternoon,
Oct. 15th., at the Halifax Golf and
Country Club according to an announcement made by Peter Doig,
the acting manager for the tournament. Entries will be received up

tddie Crowell and Peter Doig coming second and third respectively.
This year all three will be back in
competition, and some of the best
golf in the province should be exibited.

Along with these old timers
there will be the addition of two
new comers. George McLanders,
one of the most outstanding juniors to come out of the province of
Quebec, and Bennie McCallum, one
