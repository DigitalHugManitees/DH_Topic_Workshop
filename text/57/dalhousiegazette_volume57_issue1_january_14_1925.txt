EXCHANGES

Two in particular of our exchanges are note' worthy: the Trinity University Review, and
+ ‘the Student. The Student is good; even to
‘one unfamiliar with the college it represents,
jt makes pleasant reading; and holds, never» theless, a good deal of matter and of college
‘interest. The same generally can be said for

the Trinity University Review; and it was
baa only on looking over it a second time that the
» Review's slightness was evident, so pleasant
es was the reading of it. What was there was
ie good, and well written; but for a magazine
1 there was hardly enough of it.

iii There has lately been,an alarming divorce
A arranged in college publications, between the

- News, familiarly known as Fact. An account
of a football game has a tendency to be only
a summary of what the Best Paper in the
East has already said perhaps a week before;
an account of a dance is likely to consist of
the date, names of chaperones, and an estimate of the chances of its paying or being a

and with profit to themselves and us. It seems
13 and these two magazines bear witness to it,
that there is no need for the matital conflict.
College news is generally known before ever
the college paper can print it: stale news has
one excuse only, and that is, that it be entertaining. This should then be the college
paper’s function, to put entertainment before
instruction, and if foreed to deal in news
mainly, to do at least a little judicious lying.
We would not accuse the editors, of those

The Editor,

Dear Sir,—

The students of the University are wondering what has become of the Glee Club, and
why it is not functioning. In the past few
years the Glee Club has been one of the most
wide awake societies in Dalhousie, and has
been of great pleasure and benefit to the student body. Its present state of inertia is
causing a good deal of dissatisfaction among
those who have been its active and interested
members. eee bi

Clearly the fault must rest with the Execu
tive of the Club. We realize that the officers
elected last spring are very busy, and indeed
did not want to accept the responsibility. But
—if they are either unable, or have not the
inclination to exert “themselves for the
Club of which they are officers, why do they
still continue to hold their positions

work, who have the ititerest of the Glee Club

at heart, and are willing to work for it with

Class ’26 has (as everyone knows) been
gifted with an unusual personality and intelligence. It has added a further proof of
its genius in its ability to pick out such ap
honorary class president. Students would
have to go far and wide to find a better man
for the position than Dr. Nichols. He and
Miss Nichols have practically adopted us all
and have showered blessings and kindness on
our willing heads. During the holidays the
members of the class who were in the city
were invited to Dr. Nichol's home to afternoon‘tea. Twenty or more accepted this invitation and enjoyed themselves thoroughly.
The boys too seemed to have overcome their

fears of such a function and balanced their

*tea-cups with dignity and graée.

After refreshments had been bountifully

SOME YEAR-END FACTS

 

It’s a fact that the year’s end ends the
year, with its time and privileges and opportunities,

It’s a fact that, not a moment, not an Opportunity of the year can be recalled. It is
gone to céme no more.

It's-a fact, that though gone, I have still
to reckon with it and the way I have used it.

It’s a fact that I have to recken with the
past year in my own person. I, myself, am
the result of what I have thought and said
and done during the year.

These thoughts, words and deeds are forined into character, and I am better or worse
as a result of the use I have made of the
year, and in this way the past year ~ will
leave its mark upon all my future years.

It is a fact that the past year will project
itself into all my future years, not only in
effect upon my character, but in the regret
or thankfulness with which I shall in future
look back upon the year. The memory of it
will persist as well as its influence upon character.

* * «#

It is a fact that my life during the past
year has influenced the lives of others, and
that this influence, for better or worse, will
influence all the future of all these other
lives.

It is a fac tthat I have a year less of life
to do what I would like to do before the years
of life are ended.

It is a fact that God still waits to forgive
the failures and shortcomings of the year,
but that even God cannot restore what might
have been, if the year has not been used for
the best. ,

It is a fact that I have a year less of life
ean be no second chance, and so for all the
years when ended. They can come no more.

The two-fold lesson writ large on all these
facts is: first, gratitude to God that, while

the past-cannot be recalled, restored, or ;

relived, or its results undone, there is still forgiveness; and, second, earnest. purpose to
relived,-or its results undone, there is still for
main.—Record. |

__ “SPEAKING OF EXAMS——”

 

I was talking to a freshman about the
exams.

* ‘*How’d you get along in. history ’’ I asked
im.

‘‘Never had such a surprise in my life,”’’
he said, “‘I was countin’ on a pass; though
I handed in a pretty crude paper. Tell you
how it was. For one thing it was long as
aitech, ——regular writing contest.**

‘‘Exams generally are.’’ I interposed.

‘‘And facts!’’ he continued. ‘‘You'd think
it mattered who Caesar’s grandmother was.
I’d always thought exams were to see if the
students had thought about what they read;
but come to find out, it’s how much they remember. That history exam was a work of
art. It seemed to be covered with one or two
phrases, war-cries evidently-——‘Deseribe in

_ detail’, ‘Explain and expand’, and I never

drink,

‘‘T read it carefully and resolved to take
it in the spirit it was given. Then I wrote.
I deseribed Alarie’s favorite menu, as I imag

how significant it was that the Battle of | —Adrainople had been fought in Europe; ex. | i

had a superiority complex; and, erowning aM
stroke of all, clearly and cleverly pointed out a i
that Bonaparte’s insular birth and insula
death were connected by a single lifetime, ‘Tt a
ws all rot—utter nonsense! though, as I said,
I was countin’ on a pass.’’ y
‘‘And you were plucked?” I asked.

HOLIDAY TRIP OF HOCKEY TEAM

 

The Dalhousie Hockey Team gathered in

_ Halifax shortly after Christmas and proceed
ed to New Glasgow for their first game of the
season.

They met the boys from the steel town on
Monday the 29th of December and suffered
defeat by the score of 4—1.

The Tigers played well for their first assemblage together and had more than an even
break in the play and territory but were
unable to penetrate the net behind Burbar
who playd a marvelous game in goal and
stcpped a perfect avalanch of shots. The Yew
Glasgow team showed the effects of a trainer
and were in mid season form, playing their
positions well. L

Qn Tuesday the Tigers started for Charlottetown and were met on the way by Mont
Haslam who did not play in the New Glasgow
gume.

In the first game with the Abbies_ the
Islanders got away to a flying start scoring
two goals in the first period while f#hey
held the Collegians scoreless. In thé second
period however Tigers lived up to their name
and scored three times holding the lead until
the third period when the Abbies evened up
after a hard attack. No further score was
made and the game ended 3—3.

The second contest ws a whirlwind affair
before a crowded house with the Vigers showing their best form, outskating and outplaying their rival Abegweits to the tune of 4—1
goals, making the first victory obtained
against the Islanders in their home town for
three years. ‘

The Collegians scgred two in the first, one
in the second and another in the third. The
Abbies lone talley was made on an end to
end rush by Prowse with only a few minutes
tu go. he a ae

The team were royally entertained during
their stay and are very complimentary regarding the hospitality of everyone who ma:
their visit so pleasant. The Hockey team will
always. welcome another trip to Charlottetown. Manager Goss, Asst. Manager Morton
and Mr. Sterling accompanied the players.

Dalhousie Wins F rom Abbi

  

Harold Radford of the

THE DALHOUSIE GAZETTE So Nae ot a

DARTMOUTH ARE WINNERS
Dalhousie were defeated in their first game

of the City League Series 7 to 5 on Friday

night last.

Dartmouth piled up a lead of six goals in
the first period and“%t looked as if this margin
would be insurmountable. Dal’s forwards
were playing a good game but the fast Dart
mouth wings managed to shoot ¢lear of Dal’s 
defense and beat Lewis who was not up to
his usual standard in this period, although
brilliant in the remaining stages. The Dart’s
defense on the other hand was impregnable
as was also their goaler, Whelby.

However, the fondest hopes of the Dal ‘fans
were realized when it was noted that the Dal
outfit started the second seige with the upper
hand, which they maintained for the remaineder of the game. After two minutes
ot play in this period a goal was scored for
Dal from a mix-up in front ofthe Dartmouth
nets. The Dal squad was now pushing the
game, the wings skating hard and the defense
blocking well. Creighton was responsible for
Dal’s next tally, making it on a long, speedy
shot. This is Creighton’s first year on the
Senior team and he turned in an excellent
game on Friday night and should be a strong
addition to the team. Three minutes later,
Capt. Alan Dunlop, who with his partner on
the defense, Wilson, had been making some
sensational rushes, accounted for Dal’s third
and last score of the period, the count now
standing 6—3.

The fans, favorable and unfavourable, now
realized that it was to be a matter of holding
Dal down for they were hot in pursuit.

Hasla mand Bates, the old stand-bys on

the wings, were Striving their utmost and
were turning in some effective work, and were
keeping Welby busy. Haslam, with one of
his wicked shots sent Dal up another notch
meking the score 6—4. The fans went wild,
realizing that the load was quickly diminishing and half the period yet to go. However,
a minute later they were brought to earth
again by L. Beazley, who scored for Dartmouth. _Fabie managed to slam in a final
counter for Dal, this ‘ending the scoring.
Game ended 7—5. ‘ 3
The game was interesting to wateh and
clean. There were several penalties dealt out,
but only for minor offences, referees Fluck
and Butler following their policy of keeping
the game ‘as clean as possible, |
Dartmouth played several Halifax men who
had been declared ineligible some time ago
but Manager Gass of the Dal team stated that
he had no intention of protesting the game.
.An unfortunate incident of the game was
the injury to Parker Hickey’s knee which will
ineapacitate him for atime. |
