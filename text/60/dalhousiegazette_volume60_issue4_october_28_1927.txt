Don McRae of Arts was the star of
the meet winning the pole vault, tieing
with Ralph Miller in the high jump

John Hussey of Kings won the mile

Dalhousian pays his seven dollars
every year, for nothing!

Messrs Godsoe and Rankin will be
the two council members of the Dal
committee.

After a short discussion the lawyers
were awarded the privilege of holding
the first post-Christmas dance. The
Glee Club was given permission to
hold their first show of the year next
Thursday. Monday night was selected

as student's night at the Gym and any

students activities, such as the Glee
Club, dances and debates will be held
on that night. The first showing of the
Glee Club was made an exception. It is
possible that the night may be changed
after Christmas. Munroe Day will be
held after Christmas this year.

An application from Leigh Miller,
who desired to enter a team in a dual
track and field meet next Friday was
Permission was also given to

Bill Winfield to take the Freshman

Football team to Acadia on Thursday.

The most important items on the
budget were the Football grant and
the Gazette grant. Both showed substantial increases over last year and
both convinced the council of their
greater need this year. The Football
grant of $800. was passed as was the
Gazette grant of $850.00. The Glee
Club was advanced $100.00 until the
Council had the time to consider
their report, which was not detailed
enough.

A summary of the various grants
follows.

Football $800.00; Interfacultv Football $75.00; Track $59.00; D. G. A. C.

Appeal from Dalhousie Alumni

Mr. J. E.*Mitchell; Secretary D. A. A. C.,
85 Victoria Road, Halifax, N. S.

Dear Sir;—At a meeting of the Dalhousie Alumni Executive yesterday, it was decided that the Alumni would
undertake the collection of funds to make possible the trip
of the Dalhousie football team to Vancouver during the

No doubt there are many students at the University who
would like to contribute to this fund.

by purely voluntary giving, the under-graduates had subscribed, let us say, three hundred dollars ($300.00).
suggestion therefore, is that the D. A. A. C. appoint canvassers in every class in the University and see how much
can be raised next week, reporting to me not later than

notices should be posted in the buildings and that a thorAt the same time I fully realize
that there are many students who are not in position to

Please take this up with your executive and let me know
by Saturday the 15th that you have undertaken this work
and will be in position to report the result of this canvas on

Yours truly,
R. M. FIELDING,

This very delicate proposition is the
subject to be debated at Sodales on
Monday night, at 8 o'clock. Jessie
Gladwin and Hughie Turnbull will
contend that professors should be so
paid, while Eileen MacAulay and
Ray MacCunn willargue tothe contrary.

Jessie Gladwin a prominent debater
from Shirreff Hall figured very favorably in the Delta Gamma Debate with
the Halifax Ladies College, last year.
She is a member of the Student's Council and her word is known to carry
weight.

Eileen MacAulay needs no introduction to the many who saw The Delta
Gamma Show last year. Eileen has a
very scientific mind and although this
is her first appearance at Sodales, she
is well equipped as a debater both in
manner and mind.

Ray MacCunn, president of the
Junior Class, is a member of the
Students’ Council and a _ favorite

athlete on the Senior Hockey Team.
Ray thinks that profs should not be
paid on popularity basis—he is sympathetic.

Hugh Turnbull, B. A. (Dal.) is in
second year Law. Hugh has_ been
heard to good effect at the Moot Court.
He is possessed of a very keen mind
and makes a very interesting cross
examiner. He is therefore fitted as a
debater.

All four debaters are popular Dalhousians and their appearance - at

Sodales is being favorably commented
upon. The subject under fire is, to
say the least, an interesting one and
all four are capable of handling it.
Should the affirmative win, it 1s
possible a popularity contest will be

ie on for the professors. This
debate at Dalhousie will start the
ball rolling. Other colleges may take

up the ery, ‘‘Professors on Popularity
asis.’

Many prominent Dalhousians will
speak from the floor and judging
from the attendance at the first meeting—a keenly contested debate Is
anticipated.

It may be added that the executive
committee consisting of Rod MacLeod,
Josie Dresner and Jack Atwood are
leaving no sod unturned in their effort
to make this a banner year for Sodales,
for they are drawing into debating

circles the keenest minds on the campus.

[t is anticipated that many anxious
professors will be present and join the
students in their efforts to properly
solve the vexing problem.

of an August afternoon. [t was
autumn when she passed away—scarlet,
triumphant autumn that she had always
loved so well—and I can still remember
as vividly as though it were yesterday
the magical appearance of our little
front parlor on the day of her funeral.
Gorgeous peonies with the frail beautiful asters and tall rainbow sheafs of
gladioli gave more the appearance of a
festive scere than of that saddest of all
human assemblies. But it was all
as she who had passed onward to the
land of eternal color would have
wished.

There is no life, I think, which color
does not enter into to play its gorgeous
part. Those who have not beautiful
gardens have still above them the deep
cup of the starry heaven and the brave

cold face of the buttercup beside the
deen road. Color, ‘“‘the splendid
gospel of color’ as one Canadian poet
puts it, is one thing that abides always
with us the whole of the year around,
ever varying with the changing seasons
but still mighty in its power to stir
the heart to tears er uplift the soul to
rapture. Spring with purple violets
in the grass and daffodils to greet the
Easter day; summer with red roses
and sparkling sunny seas; autumn,
when every tree is made a miracle,
and winter with his scarlet banner
flung against the west, all these in their
successions pass before our eyes.
Winter steps across the frosty hills
and so it is spring again.

After all, why should we hesitate
and fear? The earth is robed in
beauty night and day, and, as for
Heaven, that trail beyond the stars,
who knows what glory of color may
wait us there?

—Florence M. Brewster °31.

NEWMAN CLUB
STILL ACTIVE

A bean supper, a Aas and a well
attended meeting is the history of the
Newman Club since Dalhousie reopened.
The meeting was held at the K. of C.
Hall, on Sunday afternoon. After the
reading of the minutes of the last
meeting and an address on Life, several
matters which had been discussed at a
previous executive meeting were brought
before the members. It was decided
that the Newman Club should have a
suitable emblem and a committee
consisting of Muriel Donahoe, Claire
Murphy, Fred Jennings and Tom
Harris were appointed to make the
selection.

Acadia at Wolfville last Saturday and
the splendid showing of Dalhousie
against the Services on the same day
would indicate that the Yellow and
Black has a good chance of victory
tomorrow. The addition of the three
stars to the Wanderers’ line-up, which
lacked them last Saturday, will, however materially strengthen that team.
Consequently it is going to be a hardfought game tomorrow, and an exciting one.

The Wanderers are out to retain the
championship. The Dalhousie squad
is just as anxious to win it, not only
for the honor attached but also to
clinch the trip to British Columbia
which has been planned for some time.
A win over the Wanderers assures
the trip to the coast, a trip that will be
not only a delight to the football squad
but a big boon for the university.

Everyone should be at the game
tomorrow to support the team. .They
merit our support, first, because they
are OUR team and, second, because
in. the games so far they have proven
themselves worthy of all the support
we can give tham.

Let us all turn out and cheer the
team on to victory and Vancouver.

DAL VS SERVICES

Playing on a soggy field and handling
a wet ball Dalhousie Tigers defeated
the United Service Rugby fifteen on the
Studley Campus last Saturday. The
Services, in spite of the fact that they
didn’t score, were in the game always
and gave the Dal supporters something
to think about on several occasions.
They dribbled well and often made
substantial gains by superior foot work.
But the Tigers were not to be denied
and these losses were regained by punts
and runs until the final whistle saw
them on the long end of a 11—0 score.

Because of injuries Ort Hewatt and
Archie MacDonald were. out of the
game and several changes were made
in the lineup. Captain Tupper was
moved from the scrum to block quarter
where he played a very effective game.
“Kelly” MacLean was on the receiving end of the scrum and appeared
to be out of place. Several times the
ball, heeled from the scrum, went right
past him to be pounced on by the
ever watchfulservice men. Kelly wasn’t
so good there and plays a much better
game as block. Two second team men,
Jones and Mitchell, occupied positions
in the half-line and scrum respectfully
and both turned in very good games.

The first score of the game was
made by the Tigers when Tuppe
picked up a loose ball, made a good
run, and passed to Langstroth who
placed the ball squarely behind the
posts. The ball was very greasy and
Ab Smith missed the bar on the try for
convert. Play then went back and
forth for some time until the ball was
passed to Jones who literally tore
thru half the Service team to start a

DALHOUSIE INTERMEDIATES DEFFAT
TECH SQUAD 9-0

TIGER CUBS SHOW IMPROVEMENT

Showing quite a change in playing
ability the Dalhousie Intermediate Rugby Team defeated the Tech squad by
nine points to nothing.

When the team lined up it looked
hike Tech's game without a doubt.
They were very superior in weight and
that with their reputed playing ability
was sure to win. However Dal made
up for lack of weight by displaying great
fighting qualities and ability to make
the breaks count.

Jennings opened the scoring when he
plunged under the scrim after the ball
had been booted down to Tech’s five
yard line. It was a nice play and he
caught the engineers napping.

In the second half it was Dal’s ball
pretty nearly all the time and they
added six more points to their score
making the final count 9—0. The

second try was made when “Cutie”’
Smith intercepted a pass on Tech's
ten yard line and went over for the
score. Sutherland and Power put the
game on ice when they staged a little
combination play and the former went
over the line.

Ed Brown former Dal three letter
man was the star of the visitors and he
was mixed up in every play. Jennings
was best for the Cubs. He was on the
ball all the time and was a constant
worry to the blue jerseyed squad.
MacCrae and ‘Cutie’ Smith closely
followed him and were good all the time.

I am about to do a preposterous thing.
I, a simple Junior, with nothing more
than what I learned in English 1 and 2
to back me, and a few scattered ideas
picked up from everywhere—or nowhere—to enlighten me, [ purpose
writing a book-review. a solemn serious
undertaking like a book-review. Ridiculous, isn’t it? I can see my wouldbe readers lifting up their hands in
holy horror at the mere suggestion, but
please don't or, if you must, lower
them again and give me a chance.
I do not guarantee that this review
will be interesting, but 1 do most heartily

uarantee that the book itself will be
interesting—to you. So please _ persevere and glance not from the printed
page until I have said my say.

The book with which I want you to
become acquainted is not a learned
book, neither is it a novel, it is not a
classic, an ‘Alger’ book, a ‘history’
or a book of poems: and it will not
help you in English 2, History 1 or any
other of your classes; it is a book to be
read for pure, unadulterated enjoy‘ment»and nothing else. If you are not
interested in enjoying yourself do not,
I beg of you, give yourself the agony of
reading further, for it will be a waste
of time. This book is filled ‘from
beginning to end with the spirit of youth,
daring youth and the joy of living.
It is exciting, thrilling, and intensely
realistic, and I cannot imagine anyone
not being interested in it. The name
of this remarkable tale is The Royal
Road to Romance and the writer is a
young American named Richard Haliburton.

The book should have a particular
interest to us as college students, for it
was written shortly after Haliburton's
graduation from Princeton, and it
reads like something that we should
all like to be capable of writing. It
also tells about things that everyone
would like to do. By the time you
have read fifty pages you will want to
drop everything, don your oldest
clothes, and start off for the other side
of the world to-morrow. At least,
that is the way | felt and nothing
could be more staid and precise than
myself in ordinary circumstances. The
introduction of such a book as this into
the Dalhousie undergraduate student
body would have disastrous results, I
fear. You have only to read Haliburton’s description of the Taj Mahal,
to become wildly desirous of spending
the night there, as he did. If, on
reading The Royal Road To Romance,
you. do not become possessed of the
desire to conquer the narrow passes of
the Matterhorn, to swim the Hellespont by moonlight, and to sleep under
the cloudless Egyptian sky on the
Pyramid of Gezih, I fear that some

Of gold and gems! Osiris!

When I was a girl, without fear or care.

And now—I may only remain to-night.

Wait! I would visit my home, if I dare,

The city is sleeping and far away

The columns are shattered,

The temple half-buried is but a den.
All, all is changed, death for life, night
for day.

Can this be the land of the lotus bloom,
Afloat on Nile’s blue waters?
My land of mysterious dreams, this

tomb

So hollow and still:like an empty room,

Where foot-steps re-echo if one but
stirs?

Shadows surrounding me waver and
loom.

But where are the singers, who. silk
bedight,

With low and haunting minor,

Enchanted the musky and moon-bathed
night,

With songs of the Sun-god, of love, of

might,
While Nilus rolled still by his age-old
shore?
Now all is silently dusty and white.

Since nothing is left but the sands that

creep
And hide my home, 'tis better
To leave it behind me, a dust-dry heap,
And bury myself in my tomb so deep.
Since there are no mourners, no eyes that

blur
I shall be quiet, forever shall sleep.

_ Richard Halliburton was graduated
in Arts from Princeton University,
and as a graduation gift to their adyventurous son, his family offered him
a ‘de luxe’ ticket around the world.
Richard declined, with thanks—he had
been there before and privately decided
to dispense with such commodities
forever. With fifty dollars in their
pockets, attired in appropriate costumes
and ‘soup-bowl’ hair-cuts, he and _ his
room-mate succeeded in bamboozling
the captain of a small European-bound
freighter into hiring them as deck-hands.
They sailed from New York with a
crew picked from every nationality
under the sun—more or less.

Through Europe they went on
bicycles, into the most remote and
interesting corners of it, as well as the
old standbys of all tourists. Haliburton views Paris from Eiffel Tower

steers a ship across the Meditteranean

And, better than doing all these things,

Last year, if I remember rightly
Dalhousie had an orchestra and Dalhousians, both those who played in it
and those who listened to it, enjoyed
that orchestra. In the spring (lee

rather sordid point of view of /nnocents Abroad, to the hearty and wholesome good humour of The Royal Road

feel, perhaps, the greater writer saw
with the eyes of a man determined to
ridicule the things which I have always
respected, and even revered, while the
younger man looked at them in the
spirit in which I should have done so,
had I had the opportunity.

Working, playing and “roughing it,”
with divers companions and a_ toothbrush for ballast, Halliburton breezes
his way over the world and_ back,’
and, when he reaches the land of his
fathers, he sits down and writes for us
the story of his travels. Such a book
is The Royal Road to Romance. But

was composed of orchestra selections.
As this was a success Dalhousie will
doubtlessly be asked to give another
Radio Show. Soloists (this must be
said to their credit) are always ready
to do all they can, but a program of
solos would not have the same appeal.
As for a play—to be a success over the
radio a play must be very well acted and
most Glee Club shbws have not the
practice necessary to meet this requirement. Besides Dalhousie wants
an orchestra, not merely for special
occasions but for herself. Since we
have the talent why not have the
Orchestra? Several of last year’s members have expressed willingness to play
if the orchestra is reorganized. Miss
Jean Shaw, who organized and directed
the orchestra, graduated last June but

Did you ever build dream castles?
Did you ever take time off from your
work, pleasures, or, yes, even trom
your studies to build beautiful little
homes for your thoughts? If you've
never done this I say you've missed
a great deal. You've missed something
which makes solitude a pleasure, and
peace and quiet things to be sought for.

I shall tell you about my castles—
the castles I build and furnish thoroughly as dwellings for my thoughts, hopes
and ambitions. I have many castles.
Some are large and spacious: others
small and cosy. Some strongly built
on a firm foundation; others toppled
over into a heap of ruins.

It is a wonderful country, the country
in which I have set up my ‘‘Hamlet of
Dreams.’ It is much like some of the
beautiful little hamlets which may be
found in some places throughout Cape
Breton. My hamlet snuggles in the
foothills of a beautiful, awe-inspiring,
and protecting mountain which shelters
it from the worst of the tempests.
In front stretches a lovely lake which,
for the most part, is usually placid.

Tis on this lake I sail my little ships
laden with ambitions and_ hopes.
Sometimes they sail completely from
view, vanish in the distance and are
never seen again. More often they
return making me very happy with
their cargoes of realized hopes and
fulfilled ambitions. One time a little
ship, which I called my ‘‘White Cloud”,
carrying my most cherished hope and
heading for my ‘‘Isle of View,” sank to
the bottom before it had gone very far
from the shore. This was a terrible
blow to me, but I have commenced a
lonely search for its cargo and I will
continue to search until I find it. When
I do I shall build it up into the most
beautiful and most wonderful castle
among my possessions, which will be
all the more dear to me on account
of the struggle through which I had to
go to attain it.

These castles are a source of great
pleasure to me. I like best to visit
them on a rainy evening in autumn,
when the wind howls about the eves,
when the rain dashes against the window,
and a log fire crackles in the grate.
‘Tis then I draw my arm-chair near
the fire and set out to visit my ‘‘Hamlet
of Dreams.”

My little people are all so delighted
to see me—Did I tell you by whom
my hamlet is inhabited? There are
many kinds of people there; charming
old ladies; kind old gentlemen, and
many, many children. The children
are my chief delight as they romp

 

 

of hygiene and leads to little clarity of thought.

Would it not be better to use that hour in conducting invigorating exercises in the gymnasium where the sluggish blood stream
could be spurred up and tired brains could be rested as only healthy
exercise can rest them? The majority of students already know
that healthy exercise, fresh air and a temperate life are conducive
to well-being. Will lectures at the eleventh hour bring home the
truth to them with greater force? Would not physical exercises

with an occasional lecture on hygiene be of greater benefit than

the present system of theory without actual practice?

 

Dalhousie. I am sure she would be glad
to give any advice and those who
worked with her last year know her
willingness to help. So why not get

 

together and see what can be done.

 

and
always smiling,

The only sadness ever felt by my
little people is occasioned when they
see one of my lovely castles crash

suddenly in a heap of ruins. Then all
is sadness for awhile, for all know how
I suffer when an ambition is thwarted,
a hope battered or a wish unfulfilled.
However they soon commence to do all
in their power to help me forget my loss.
they plant vines and flowers over the
ruins, and soon, where once stood the
castle there is a beautiful garden,
growing as on a mound. This mound
is all that is left to remind me of my
loss, and even as that becomes beautiful
my sadness turns to pleasure.

There is but one dark cloud in my
“Hamlet of Dreams’. It hangs near
the horizon, not entirely shutting out
the sun, but continually casting its
shadow over my _ castles. It was
occasioned by the loss of my ‘‘White
Cloud”. When I have found and salvaged the cargo of this ship, and have
built my most beautiful castle [ shall
tell you about it. Till then—adieu.

 

 

—Dreamer, '29.
FOR YOU?
It is enveloped in darkness. All

about it are sparkling lights but none
can penetrate.
It is small yet there is ample space.
To its precincts are waited cries of
boisterous mirth mingled with soft
laughter and the strains of music. It is
in silent contrast.
People pass to and fro before it.
But they do not enter, nor even pause.
It sees all, hears all and remains in
secrecy.
It is the ideal sitting out place.

Change

The sun has passed from the hillside
The ploughmen from the field
The brooklet has ceased her laughter
The harvest has shot her yield.

Fall soft, fall soft, ye rose leaves
From the flower’s withered head;
Your petals are soft embalmers

Of the thought of a joy that is dead.

Fall fast, fail fast, ye rain drops
Fall from the sobbing sky;
Your whirling wail is the echo
Of a speechless agony.

Fall cold, fall cold, ye snow flakes
Fall from the biting sky

And freeze in the ice of your bosom
The heart's forgotten cry.

New suns will bless the hillside
New ploughs the fields shall tame
The laugh will return to the river,
But oh, will they be the same?

Re Notice Boards

 

A propos of nothing at all it may be
stated that it is rather difficult to read
Notice Boards these days. Among
somewhat hazy remembrances of freshman days is a vague recollection of
advice found in a handbook—Read the
Notice Boards. Now freshmen as well
as Sophomores, Juniors and Seniors
attempting to follow this advice need to
take half an hour or so from less_ strenuous duties. For by the time one has
read three or four lines of all the old
notices, before finding anything new
it is time to hie onself to a class
notice of whose change one has missed
Needless to say after several such
trials one is somewhat tempted to give
up trying to read notice boards as
a bad job and trust to the luck to which
one has to trust anyhow. All of which
might be eliminated if the people who
put up notices would take them down
when their life of usefulness is over.

possess too much COMMON sense.

And as for that ‘‘Seclusion”’ business
consult your history. “‘Seclusion theories
as a basis for poetry will vanish as
chaff before the wind.”

History, you know, is first an excuse
for society to look into the private
lives of famous people. One glance
into the lives of our real poets and we
know why ovr young men do not
attract the Muse. They are no poets
for they are such quiet home boys.

“Rare Ben Johnson” was a_ jolly

good fellow which.nobody can deny,

he spent his time feasting and drinking;
dwelling and escaping the gallows.
That's why he is a poet.

Then there's our friend ‘‘Christie”’
Marlowe who died with somebody
else’s dagger in his back.

Lucretius is a classical example of a
tegular guy who died with his own
dagger in his back. He also wrote.

And Bill Shakespeare didn’t spend
his time at home minding babies either.

Of course a mild example is Sam
Johnson who only wrote a dictionary.
He wasn’t a regular guy—he only
took off his shoes at dinner and spilled
his soup in ladies’ laps.

The best our boys can do today is to
spill soup on their own vests. They are
mild innocent children who go quietly
to college—their only vice is jazz
dancing. And yet they aspire to
Poetry. Ah! Poetical Delusion! Alas
they are unable to invoke the Muse.
They do not dope or drink or dissipate.

From years of observation we have
compounded seven cardinal rules on
‘How To Become a Poet,’ or ‘‘Revoke
the Muse.”

These rules we give to the public
free of charge.

(1) Never cut or comb your hair.

(2) Never shave—allow soft fuzz
to cover your physiognomy.

(3) Wear no tie.

(4) Keep trousers baggy at knees.

(5) Meander about talking to your- ||

self.

(6) Cardinal of Cardinals Do not
notice your friends.

If a poet you would be

A VISIT TO WATERLOO

 

From the ancient and historical city

of Brussels, where once there ‘was
mounting in hot haste,”’ one takes a
tram out along that road by which the
army of Wellington ‘‘weat powering
amain.” After a drive of an

The only object of interest in
is the church, which was
standing in the days of battle, and
number -of British
officers were buried. The church is at
right angles to the road and instead of a
porch, it has a large circular chapel.
On the sides of this chapel are numerous
memorial tablets, upon which appear
the names like Ramsey, Gordon, How
ard and so on, names familiar in English
history for many a century. What is
remarkable is the number of young men
commemorated here.

From Brussels to Waterloo and
beyond, the line of houses on either
side of the road is almost unbroken.
The aspect of the country is much
the same as it was a hundred and ten
years ago. Beyond Mont St. Jean,
however, the houses stop and then
commences the battlefield.

Wellington made a great move
when he chose Waterloo. Two years
before he had ordered this very field
to be surveyed, as a possible battlefield and so he knew every knoll and
hoilow. It is situated at a cross-road.
The road from Lanvain to Nevello
crosses that from Brussels to Charlevois,
and a few hundred yards from their
crossing they are united by the famous
sunken road, so that the three roads
make a kind of a huge A. The height
of land i¢ at the top of this A, and
standing there Wellington had the
entire battle under his eye, while
Napoleon could see very little of the
field at one time.

In a line paralell to the sunken
road were four buildings—the chateau of
Hugoment, the farms of LaHaye
Gainte, Papelatte and la Hare. Wellington selected these as his outposts and
had them arranged for defence.

In 1832 the government of the low
countries erected a huge earth pyramic
with a Belgium lion on the top, to mark
the line of action. From the top of this
one can see in all directions. The four
buildings which took such an important
part in the battle are clearly visible

Walsh, K. C., then spoke to the jury
for the prosecution. He reminded the
jury that Gavsie’s evidence showed that
Guss’s article tended to arouse public
feeling against the Moot Court. He
pointed out that as the prisoner had
been shown to have a faulty memory
his evidence would be of no yalue.
He stressed the low character of the
prisoner and the utter unreliability of
Kelloway as a witness.

The Chief Justice then presented the
case to the jurors. He instructed to
pay attention to the influence of the
prisoner’s articles rather than their
truth.

He pointed out that Kelloway was
utterly unreliable as a witness and that
they must base their verdict on the
evidence given by Gavsie.

After a few minutes of deliberation
the jury returned a verdict of ‘‘Guilty”
on the charge of seditious, libel and
“Not Guilty’ on the charge of blasphemous libel. The jury recommended a sentence for the prisoner and the ||

(An Appreciation)

I have travelled the whole world over.

[ have seen the sea in its angriest
moments, towering above me like a
great god of destruction. I have seen
the mists drifting like phantastic things
over the purple crests of the Sierras.
[ have stalked the graceful denizens of
the jungle and watched sportive whales
hurl their huge bulls through the air.
{ have seen the eagle hover above me
in flight.

The greatest artists of the world,
dancers, divers, athletes, have performed
before me. But for symmetry, for
sheer beauty of form and significance of
execution there is one thing which
surpasses all of these. It is that motion
of my dentist’s arm with which he

pushed away the drill for the last time.

Besides these objects of interest there
are a number of monuments on the

French and Prussians. The French one
is the best. It is a rough stone tablet

We see by the Sheaf that a new variety
examination has been inculated at
the University of Saskatchewan. The
Freshettes were required to write an
examination set by the Student Govern
ment on “The Greenhorn’s Guide’’.

One of the questions was. ‘Give your |

idea of the conduct of a model University co-ed.’ Here is a choice’ morsel.
‘She should have a deep regard for the
University as a whole, and for professors
in particular. The professors have to

opinion is. “She should not smoke of

collection is contained in these few
words. ‘while in lectures she must
fix her attention on the lecturer; truly
this is ‘the most unkindest,....... *
No doubt such an examination conducted at Dalhousie would reveal
interesting and enlightening facts, but
we feel that nothing like this would
come to light.

Interfaculty Rugby

Three games have been played in
Interfaculty Rugby during the past
week and from present indications it
would seem as if the Lawyers will be
crowned champions. All the games
have been bitterly fought with very
few scores made and in some instances
good exhibitions have been handed out
to the handful of rooters who turn out
to support their respective faculties.

Both Law and Medicine played two
games with the lawyers showing the
best form to beat the Engineers and
hold Medicine to a scoreless tie. The
Dents as yet have been unable to score
and last week they played another one
of those scoreless draws with Medicine.

There are some fair players on all of
the teams and a little initiative on the
part of the various managers as regards
practice will do a lot to improve the
ames.

combination from Sutherland to Langstroth to “Ab’’ Smith who plunged
over the line for three more points.
It was a very fine exhibition of ball
handling but Ab missed the convert
again. The final score of the game
was made from a scrum on the Services
five yard line when Maclean plunged
through the pack to fall over the line.
It was in a hard position but ‘‘Ab”’
came through and the score was 11—0.

For the Services, MacDonald, fullback and Hope as block-quarter were
the best. Hope was in every play and
gave the Tigers quite a bit of worry.
Every one of the Da! team played well
but perhaps Wickwire, Tupper and
Mitchell were a little better than their
team mates. i

On due investigation and consideration,

“CHEATING CHEATERS”
AT THE ORPHEUS

 

The Suspense Holds—and when you
say that about a picture you mean it.
you've got the last word in entertainment. In Cheating Cheaters you've
got just that— Mystery that mystifies!—
Intrigue that baffles you to the last
fade-out—Drama tense with interest
and suspense—and hilarious comedy
(in which the whole cast takes part)
running all through the picture.

 

The Greatest Asset of a busi- |
ness 4s to give customers
what they wanit—when they
want it.
