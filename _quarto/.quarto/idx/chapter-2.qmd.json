For our Gazette project, you can find high quality scans of documents [here at the Dalhousie Gazette Archives.](https://findingaids.library.dal.ca/dalhousie-gazette \"Link to Dalhousie Gazette Archives\") You can find the current Gazette [here.](https://dalgazette.com/)\n\n![](images/Screen%20Shot%202022-09-04%20at%203.26.51%20PM.png){fig-alt=\"Dal Gazette logo\"}\n\nThe following is an example screenshot of a multi-page scanned image PDF file of a 1922 Dalhousie Gazette.\n\n![](images/Screen%20Shot%202022-09-04%20at%203.23.58%20PM.png){fig-alt=\"Scan of a 1922 Gazette front page\"}\n\n## Other source materials\n\nYou can also use other source materials as you get comfortable with this process. Some examples include:\n\n-   images of texts taken with your smartphone.\n\n## What it can't do\n\nThe OCR notebook we provide uses PyTesseract, which is a Python wrapper for Google's Tesseract OCR library. It is not intended for analyzing handwritting. [This article](https://joseurena.medium.com/tesseract-ocr-evaluating-handwritten-text-recognition-1c6db85b2e7f) on medium.com illustrates some of the challenges. For analysis of handwriting, you will want Human Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR). For those with Python experience and time to create training datasets, you can find more [here](https://pythonawesome.com/handwritten-text-recognition-htr-system-implemented-with-tensorflow/).\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"chapter-2.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.1.149","theme":{"light":"flatly","dark":"darkly"},"title":"Source material","author":"the Manateam","editor":"visual"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
