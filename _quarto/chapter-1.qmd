# Getting Started

## Google account

You will need a Google account to use the notebooks, which are on Google Colab. You can set on up [Set up new Google account](https://accounts.google.com/signup/v2/webcreateaccount?flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=SignUp "Google account setup").

This does not have to be your personal account, you can set one up just for data analysis, if you like.

If you already have one, feel free to skip ahead to Chapter 2.
