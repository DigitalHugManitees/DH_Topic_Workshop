CJNM2ESH,journalArticle,2012,"Johnson, Susan M.; Kraft, Matthew A.; Papay, John P.",How Context Matters in High-Need Schools: The Effects of Teachers’ Working Conditions on Their Professional Satisfaction and Their Students’ Achievement,Teachers College Record,,0161-4681,10.1177/016146811211401004,https://doi.org/10.1177/016146811211401004,"Background/ContextEducational policy makers have begun to recognize the challenges posed by teacher turnover. Schools and students pay a price when new teachers leave the profession after only 2 or 3 years, just when they have acquired valuable teaching experience. Persistent turnover also disrupts efforts to build a strong organizational culture and to sustain coordinated instructional programs throughout the school. Retaining effective teachers is a particular challenge for schools that serve high proportions of low-income and minority students. Although some interpret these turnover patterns as evidence of teachers? discontent with their students, recent large-scale quantitative studies provide evidence that teachers choose to leave schools with poor work environments and that these conditions are most common in schools that minority and low-income students typically attend. Thus, mounting evidence suggests that the seeming relationship between student demographics and teacher turnover is driven not by teachers? responses to their students, but by the conditions in which they must teach and their students are obliged to learn.Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of StudyWe build on this body of work by further examining how working conditions predict both teachers? job satisfaction and their career plans. We use a broad conception of the context of teachers? work, paying attention not only to narrowly defined working conditions but also to the interpersonal and organizational contexts in which teachers work. We also extend Ladd's analysis describing the relationship between the work context and student achievement. Advancing our understanding of this relationship is particularly important, given the increasing emphasis legislators place on evidence of student achievement when evaluating education policy. Specifically, we ask three research questions: (1) Do the conditions of work in Massachusetts public schools affect teachers? satisfaction with their jobs and their career plans? (2) Are schools with better conditions of work more successful in raising student performance than schools with less supportive working conditions? (3) If the conditions of work are important, what elements of the work environment matter the most?Research DesignIn this article, we combine a statewide survey of school working conditions (MassTeLLS) with demographic and student achievement data from Massachusetts. We examine three primary outcomes: teacher satisfaction, teacher career intentions, and student achievement growth. From different items on the MassTeLLS, we construct a set of nine key elements that reflect the broad-based conditions in which teachers work. We fit standard regression models that describe the relationship between each outcome and both overall conditions of work and each element separately, modeling this relationship according to the properties of our outcome variables.Findings/ResultsWe found that measures of the school environment explain away much of the apparent relationship between teacher satisfaction and student demographic characteristics. The conditions in which teachers work matter a great deal to them and, ultimately, to their students. Teachers are more satisfied and plan to stay longer in schools that have a positive work context, independent of the school's student demographic characteristics. Furthermore, although a wide range of working conditions matter to teachers, the specific elements of the work environment that matter the most to teachers are not narrowly conceived working conditions such as clean and well-maintained facilities or access to modern instructional technology. Instead, it is the social conditions?the school's culture, the principal's leadership, and relationships among colleagues?that predominate in predicting teachers? job satisfaction and career plans. More important, providing a supportive context in which teachers can work appears to contribute to improved student achievement. We found that favorable conditions of work predict higher rates of student academic growth, even when we compare schools serving demographically similar groups of students.Conclusions/RecommendationsIn short, we found that the conditions of teachers? work matter a great deal. These results align with a growing body of work examining the organizational characteristics of the schools in which teachers work. Together, these studies suggest strongly that the high turnover rates of teachers in schools with substantial populations of low-income and minority students are driven largely by teachers fleeing the dysfunctional and unsupportive work environments in the schools to which low-income and minority students are most likely to be assigned. If public education is to provide effective teachers for all students, then the schools those students attend must become places that support effective teaching and learning across all classrooms.",10/1/2012,7/2/2022 18:17,7/2/2022 18:17,5/1/2022 13:22,Jan-39,,10,114,,Teachers College Record,How Context Matters in High-Need Schools,,,,,,,en,,,,,SAGE Journals,,Publisher: SAGE Publications,,/Users/nicolapoppy/Zotero/storage/5K524DSR/Johnson et al_2012_How Context Matters in High-Need Schools.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The research reported here suggests that in elementary classrooms, effective teaching skills are effective for all students, both with and without special education needs. Drawing on a research programme extending over nearly two decades, we make the case that effective inclusionary practices, and therefore overall effective teaching, depend in part on the beliefs of teachers about the nature of disability, and about their roles and responsibilities in working with students with special education needs. Elementary classroom teachers who believe students with special needs are their responsibility tend to be more effective overall with all of their students. We provide evidence to suggest that teachers' beliefs about disability and about their responsibilities for their students with disabilities and special educational needs may be part of a broader set of attitudes and beliefs about the nature of ability and about the nature of knowledge, knowing and how learning proceeds; that is, epistemological beliefs. The implications for these findings are considerable for teacher training and development. Little is known about how skills for effective inclusion are developed, or about how changes in teachers' beliefs about disability, ability and their epistemological beliefs may be reflected in changes in their practices.

In this paper, a new hybrid algorithm named teaching-learning-based cuckoo search (TLCS) is proposed for parameter optimization problems in structure designing as well as machining processes. The TLCS combines the Lévy flight with teaching-learning process, then evolves with a co-evolutionary mechanism: for solutions to be abandoned in the cuckoo search will perform Lévy flight to generate new solutions, while for other better solutions, the teaching-learning process is used to improve the local searching ability of the algorithm. Then the proposed TLCS method is adopted into several well-known engineering parameter optimization problems.

Standardized courses for first-hour management (ATLS) have been widely accepted. A teaching format based upon video recording of every resuscitation has been developed. Tapes are reviewed by the staff and by the individuals involved in a particular resuscitation. In a weekly resuscitation review conference, actual footage is presented to the trauma team members, specific aspects of a resuscitation are critiqued, and supplemental didactic information is presented.         Legal problems have been avoided by making the review and conference a part of the quality assurance process. Patient anonymity is preserved by positioning the video camera at the foot of the resuscitation bed. Tapes are erased after each conference.         Video recording allows analysis of: 1) priorities during the resuscitation; 2) cognitive integration of the workup by the team leader; 3) physical integration of the workup by the team leader; 4) team member adherence to assigned responsibilities, resuscitation time, errors or breaks in technique; and 5) behavior change over time.

We hypothesized that 1) academic performance is related to lecture attendance and 2) learning style influences lecture attendance and, consequently, affects performance. We also speculated that the availability of alternative resources would affect this relationship. Second-year Bachelor of Science physiology students (n = 120) self-reported their lecture attendance in a block of 21 lectures (attendance not compulsory) and use of alternative resources. Overall self-reported lecture attendance was 73 ± 2%. Female students (n = 71) attended more lectures (16.4 ± 0.6) than male students (14.3 ± 0.08, n = 49) and achieved a higher composite mark in all assessments (73.6% vs. 69.3%, P < 0.02). Marks in the final exam were not statistically different between the sexes and correlated only weakly with lecture attendance (r = 0.29, n = 49, P < 0.04 for male students; r = 0.10, n = 71, P = not significant for female students; and r =0.21, n = 120, P < 0.02 for the whole class). Of the students who passed the exam, poor attenders (<11 lectures) reported significantly more use of lecture recordings (37 ± 8%, n = 15, vs. 10 ± 1%, n = 85, P < 0.001). In a VARK learning style assessment (where V is visual, A is auditory, R is reading/writing, and K is kinesthetic), students were multimodal, although female students had a slightly higher average percentage of the R learning style (preferred read/write) compared with male students (28.9 ± 0.9%, n = 63, vs. 25.3 ± 1.3%, n = 32, P < 0.03). Lecture attendance was not correlated with measured learning style. We concluded that lecture attendance is only weakly correlated with academic performance and is not related to learning style.

Only recently has technology advanced to allow application to the complex field of trauma resuscitation. The purpose of our study was to validate an advanced HPS as an evaluation tool of trauma team resuscitation skills.         Methods           The pilot study evaluated 10 three-person military resuscitation teams from community hospitals that participated in a 28-day rotation at a civilian trauma center. Each team consisted of physicians, nurses, and medics. Using the HPS, teams were evaluated on arrival and again on completion of the rotation. In addition, the 10 trauma teams were compared with 5 expert teams composed of experienced trauma surgeons and nurses. Two standardized trauma scenarios were used, representing a severely injured patient with multiple injuries and with an Injury Severity Score of 41 (probability of survival, 50%). Performance was measured using a unique human performance assessment tool that included five scored and eight timed tasks generally accepted as critical to the initial assessment and treatment of a trauma patient. Scored tasks included airway, breathing, circulation, and disability assessments as well as overall organizational skills and a total score. The nonparametric Wilcoxon test was used to compare the military teams’ scores for scenarios 1 and 2, and the comparison of the military teams’ final scores with the expert teams. A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant.         Results           The 10 military teams demonstrated significant improvement in four of the five scored (p ≤ 0.05) and six of the eight timed (p ≤ 0.05) tasks during the final scenario. This improvement reflects the teams’ cumulative didactic and clinical experience during the 28-day trauma refresher course as well as some degree of simulator familiarization. Improved final scores reflected efficient and coordinated team efforts. The military teams’ initial scores were worse than the expert group in all categories, but their final scores were only lower than the expert groups in 2 of 13 measurements (p ≤ 0.05).         Conclusion           No studies have validated the use of the HPS as an effective teaching or evaluation tool in the complex field of trauma resuscitation. These pilot data demonstrate the ability to evaluate trauma team performance in a reproducible fashion.

However, there is some doubt as to whether these evaluation instruments accurately measure the quality of course content, teaching and knowledge transfer. We investigated whether the provision of chocolate cookies as a content-unrelated intervention influences SET results. Methods We performed a randomised controlled trial in the setting of a curricular emergency medicine course. Participants were 118 third-year medical students. Participants were randomly allocated into 20 groups, 10 of which had free access to 500 g of chocolate cookies during an emergency medicine course session (cookie group) and 10 of which did not (control group). All groups were taught by the same teachers. Educational content and course material were the same for both groups. After the course, all students were asked to complete a 38-question evaluation form. Results A total of 112 students completed the evaluation form.

A sample of 222 teachers and 875 children participated in a large, multi-site study. Classroom quality was defined as effective teacher–child interactions and measured by the Classroom Assessment Scoring System. Children’s language, literacy, and inhibitory control were assessed in the fall and spring. Using predetermined thresholds for high quality, associations between quality and children’s skills in inhibitory control and phonological awareness were greater when CLASS Emotional Support was rated higher, while associations between quality and skills in literacy (phonological awareness and print knowledge) were greater in classrooms in which CLASS Classroom Organization scores were higher. Effect sizes were moderate to large (d=0.43–0.84) for associations between outcomes and quality in the higher quality ranges. Empirical approaches to identify thresholds, indicated relations between inhibitory control and both Classroom Organization and Emotional Support as higher when teacher–child interactions were rated as more effective. These results contribute to emerging evidence that features of classroom experience, such as qualities of teacher–child interactions, are more strongly associated with higher levels of children’s school readiness skills when the nature of those experiences (i.e., interactions) are in the upper ranges of the distribution. However, the evidence reported herein do not warrant recommendations for specific thresholds and inconsistencies in the study’s findings in comparison to previous research require further investigation before direct implications for thresholds in quality would be warranted.",7/1/2016,7/2/2022 18:17,7/2/2022 18:17,5/19/2022 16:21,561-571,,,36,,Early Childhood Research Quarterly,,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,/Users/nicolapoppy/Zotero/storage/TTJSRXF5/Hatfield et al. - 2016 - Thresholds in the association between quality of t.pdf; /Users/nicolapoppy/Zotero/storage/NP69643X/S0885200615300053.html,,,Child care quality; Classroom assessment scoring system; Preschool/pre-kindergarten; School readiness skills; Teacher–child interactions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, very few studies have investigated the effects of these epistemological beliefs in teaching. The purpose of this study was to test the hypotheses that teachers holding constructivist beliefs (a) are more likely to detect student alternative conceptions; (b) have a richer repertoire of teaching strategies; (c) use potentially more effective teaching strategies for inducing student conceptual change; (d) report more frequent use of effective teaching strategies: and (e) highly valuate these teaching strategies compared with teachers holding empiricist beliefs. Through the use of a three-part questionnaire consisting of critical incidents, direct questions about teacher strategies of conceptual change, and ratings of the use and importance of specific teaching strategies, data were obtained from 35 science teachers with different science backgrounds and teaching at different educational levels.

It is argued that success in meeting this demand will continue to elude us as long as the conventional approaches to educational R&D persist.

The evidence at first seems contradictory, as the quality of instruction appears to decline following turnover despite the fact that most work shows higher attrition for less effective teachers. This raises concerns that confounding factors bias estimates of transition differences in teacher effectiveness, the adverse effects of turnover or both. After taking more extensive steps to account for nonrandom sorting of students into classrooms and endogenous teacher exits and grade-switching, we replicate existing findings of adverse selection out of schools and negative effects of turnover in lower-achievement schools.

With more than a decade of experience and research, it is timely to assess empirical evidence bearing on the efficacy of this school improvement strategy. This paper examines the new generation of teacher evaluation along three lines of analysis: evidence on the magnitude, consistency, and stability of teacher effects on student learning, evidence on the impact of teacher evaluation on growth in student learning, and literature from the sociology of organizations on how schools function. Although the trend towards focusing on teacher evaluation is increasingly evident internationally, most of the empirical research evaluated in this paper is from the USA. This critical evaluation of the empirical literature yields two key conclusions. First, we conclude that the policy logic supporting this reform remains considerably stronger than the empirical evidence.

Specifically, we tested an integrated model including both a ‘bright’ path from perceived autonomy-supportive teaching through need satisfaction toward autonomous motivation and a ‘dark’ pathway from perceived controlling teaching through need frustration toward controlled motivation, amotivation, and oppositional defiance. Design Cross-sectional study. Methods To investigate the proposed paths structural equation modeling was used in a sample of 499 secondary school students (44% boys, Mage = 15.77 ± 1.16). Results We found that perceived autonomy-supportive and controlling teaching, as well as need satisfaction and need frustration, constitute different constructs relating distinctively to motivational outcomes. Consistent with the notion of a bright and dark path, perceived autonomy support was related primarily to autonomous motivation, with need satisfaction mediating this association, whereas perceived controlling teaching was related primarily to controlled motivation and amotivation, through need frustration. Perceived controlling teaching also displayed a direct and unique relationship with oppositional defiance.

In retrospect, older discriminant-validity concerns were not so much resolved as they were displaced from research attention by accumulating evidence for convergent validity. This article introduces a Current Issues section that gives new attention to validity concerns associated with student ratings. The section's 4 articles deal, respectively, with (a) conceptual structure (are student ratings unidimensional or multidimensional?), (b) convergent validity (how well do ratings correlate with other indicators of effective teaching?), (c) discriminant validity (are ratings influenced by factors other than teaching effectiveness?), and (d) consequential validity (are ratings used effectively in personnel development and evaluation?).

The authors sought to identify reasons for the decrease in bedside rounds, actual barriers to bedside rounds, methods to overcome trainee apprehensions, and proposed strategies to educate faculty.         Method          A qualitative inductive thematic analysis using transcripts from audio-recorded, semistructured telephone interviews with a purposive sampling of 34 inpatient attending physicians from 10 academic U.S. institutions who met specific inclusion criteria for “bedside rounds” was performed in 2010.

Primary reasons for the perceived decline in bedside rounds were physician- and systems related, although actual barriers encountered related to systems, time, and physician-specific issues. To address resident apprehensions, six themes were identified: build partnerships, create safe learning environments, overcome with experience, make bedside rounds educationally worthwhile, respect trainee time, and highlight positive impact on patient care. Potential strategies for educating faculty were identified, most commonly faculty development initiatives, divisional/departmental culture change, and one-on-one shadowing opportunities.

PARTICIPANTS: Participants included 57 second- and third-year internal medicine residents that were randomized to the intervention group (n = 28) or to the control group (n = 29). INTERVENTION: The intervention was a 1-hour session incorporating lecture, group discussion, and role-play. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Primary outcome measures were resident self-report and learner ratings of resident performance of the OMP teaching behaviors. Residents assigned to the intervention group reported statistically significant changes in all behaviors (P < .05). Eighty-seven percent of residents rated the intervention as “useful or very useful” on a 1–5 point scale with a mean of 4.28.

Yet the adoption of such practices has been slow at many institutions. Efforts to bridge the gap between research and practice are needed. Purpose We describe an institutional change plan we developed to bridge this research-to- practice gap. Our plan is grounded in research and theories about faculty motivation and organizational change, and we designed it using local evidence from the University of Michigan College of Engineering. Design/Method We collected local data from three sources to provide context for our institutional change plan. First, faculty focus groups allowed us to determine factors that influence faculty adoption of effective teaching practices. Second, classroom observations allowed us to ascertain current teaching practices. Third, a student survey allowed us to identify teaching practices perceived by students to enhance their success. We used this local evidence with a “who/what/how” decision-making process to design our change plan. Results Our institutional change plan for accelerating the adoption of effective teaching practices comprises a faculty action plan and an administrative change plan.

We focus on classes taken during a student’s first term at Northwestern and employ an identification strategy in which we control for both student-level fixed effects and next-class-taken fixed effects to measure the degree to which contingent faculty contribute more or less to lasting student learning than do other faculty. We find consistent evidence that students learn relatively more from contingent faculty in their firstterm courses. This result is driven by the fact that the bottom quarter of tenure track/tenured faculty (as indicted by our measure of teaching effectiveness) has lower “value added” than their contingent counterparts. Differences between contingent and tenure track/tenured faculty are present across a wide variety of subject areas and are particularly pronounced for Northwestern’s averages and less-qualified students.,10/1/2015,7/2/2022 18:17,7/2/2022 18:17,5/20/2022 0:56,715-724,,4,97,,The Review of Economics and Statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,Silverchair,,,,/Users/nicolapoppy/Zotero/storage/R6IPZWZF/Figlio et al_2015_Are Tenure Track Professors Better Teachers.pdf; /Users/nicolapoppy/Zotero/storage/E7JGIQJ7/Are-Tenure-Track-Professors-Better-Teachers.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The impact of teacher attrition on overall teacher quality will depend on the effectiveness of teachers who leave the profession. Likewise, teacher turnover may alleviate or worsen inequities in the distribution of teachers, depending on which teachers change schools or leave teaching and who replaces them. Using matched student–teacher panel data from the state of Florida, we examine teacher mobility across the distribution of effectiveness (as measured by teacher value added). We find that top-quartile and bottom-quartile teachers exit at a higher rate than do average-quality teachers. Additionally, as the share of peer teachers with more experience, advanced degrees, or professional certification increases, the likelihood of moving within-district decreases.

Background There is poor conceptual clarity surrounding fundamental care. The Fundamentals of Care Framework aims to overcome this problem by outlining three core dimensions underpinning such care. Implementing the Framework requires a standardised definition for fundamental care that reflects the Framework's conceptual understanding, as well as agreement on the elements that comprise such care (i.e., patient needs, such as nutrition, and nurse actions, such as empathy). This study sought to achieve this consensus. Design Modified Delphi study. Methods Three phases: (i) engaging stakeholders via an interactive workshop; (ii) using workshop findings to develop a preliminary definition for, and identify the discrete elements that constitute, fundamental care; and (iii) gaining consensus on the definition and elements via a two-round Delphi approach (Round 1 n = 38; Round 2 n = 28). Results Delphi participants perceived both the definition and elements generated from the workshop as comprehensive, but beyond the scope of fundamental care. Participants questioned whether the definition should focus on patient needs and nurse actions, or more broadly on how fundamental care should be delivered (e.g., through a trusting nurse–patient relationship), and the outcomes of this care delivery. There were also mixed opinions whether the definition should be nursing specific. Conclusions This study has initiated crucial dialogue around how fundamental care is conceptualised and defined. Future work should focus on further refinements of the definition and elements with a larger, international group of practising nurses and service users. Relevance to clinical practice The definition and elements, through ongoing refinement, will contribute to a robust evidence base that will underpin policy development and the systematic and effective teaching, delivery, measurement and evaluation of fundamental care.",2018,7/2/2022 18:17,7/2/2022 18:17,5/19/2022 23:24,2285-2299,,12-Nov,27,,,Towards a standardised definition for fundamental care,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/jocn.14247,,/Users/nicolapoppy/Zotero/storage/B6AEMNWB/Feo et al. - 2018 - Towards a standardised definition for fundamental .pdf,,,basic nursing care; definition; Delphi study; fundamental care; fundamentals of care,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

E-learning plays an important role in surgical education today, with many e-learning projects already available on the Internet. Educational Theory E-learning is based on a mixture of educational theories that derive from behaviorist, cognitivist, and constructivist educational theoretical frameworks. Can Educational Theory Improve E-Learning? Conventional educational theory can be applied to improve the quality and effectiveness of e-learning. The theory of “threshold concepts” and educational theories on reflection, motivation, and communities of practice can be applied when designing e-learning material. E-Learning in Surgical Education E-learning has many advantages but also has weaknesses. Studies have shown that e-learning is an effective teaching method that offers high levels of learner satisfaction. Instead of trying to compare e-learning with traditional methods of teaching, it is better to integrate in e-learning elements of traditional teaching that have been proven to be effective. Conclusions E-learning can play an important role in surgical education as a blended approach, combined with more traditional methods of teaching, which offer better face-to-interaction with patients and colleagues in different circumstances and hands on practice of practical skills. National provision of e-learning can make evaluation easier. The correct utilization of Internet and computer resources combined with the application of valid conventional educational theory to design e-learning relevant to the various levels of surgical training can be effective in the training of future surgeons.",9/1/2012,7/2/2022 18:17,7/2/2022 18:17,5/19/2022 23:51,665-669,,5,69,,Journal of Surgical Education,,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,/Users/nicolapoppy/Zotero/storage/WY92CBUX/Evgeniou and Loizou - 2012 - The Theoretical Base of E-Learning and Its Role in.pdf; /Users/nicolapoppy/Zotero/storage/9DKY5SEE/S1931720412001584.html,,,e-learning; educational theory; Medical Knowledge; Practice Based Learning; surgical education; Systems Based Practice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Psychologists should play a leadership role in mitigating school violence, including violence directed toward teachers. There is a need for psychologists to conduct research accurately assessing the types and scope of violence that teachers experience; to comprehensively evaluate the individual, classroom, school, community, institutional, and cultural contextual factors that might predict and/or explain types of teacher violence; and to examine the effectiveness and sustainability of classroom, school, and district-wide prevention and intervention strategies that target teacher violence in school systems.

They therefore resort to advice from more experienced lecturers, to formal training processes such as specializations, master or doctoral degrees, or to self-training. High costs in time and money are invariably involved in the processes of formal training, while self-training and advice each bring their own specific risks (e.g. of following new trends that are not fully evaluated or the risk of applying techniques that are inappropriate in specific contexts).This paper presents a system that allows lecturers to define their best teaching strategies for use in the context of a specific class. The context is defined by: the specific characteristics of the subject being treated, the specific objectives that are expected to be achieved in the classroom session, the profile of the students on the course, the dominant characteristics of the teacher, and the classroom environment for each session, among others. The system presented is the Recommendation System of Pedagogical Patterns (RSPP). To construct the RSPP, an ontology representing the pedagogical patterns and their interaction with the fundamentals of the educational process was defined. A web information system was also defined to record information on courses, students, lecturers, etc.; an option based on a unified hybrid model (for content and collaborative filtering) of recommendations for pedagogical patterns was further added to the system. RSPP features a minable view, a tabular structure that summarizes and organizes the information registered in the rest of the system as well as facilitating the task of recommendation. The data recorded in the minable view is taken to a latent space, where noise is reduced and the essence of the information contained in the structure is distilled. This process makes use of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), commonly used by information retrieval and recommendation systems. Satisfactory results both in the accuracy of the recommendations and in the use of the general application open the door for further research and expand the role of recommender systems in educational teacher support processes.",5/1/2013,7/2/2022 18:17,7/2/2022 18:17,5/19/2022 23:07,607-625,,3,49,,Information Processing & Management,,Personalization and Recommendation in Information Access,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,/Users/nicolapoppy/Zotero/storage/XZ22LD7D/Cobos et al. - 2013 - A hybrid system of pedagogical pattern recommendat.pdf; /Users/nicolapoppy/Zotero/storage/9LDPDP2A/S0306457312001409.html,,,Cosine similarity; Singular value decomposition; Recommender systems; Pedagogical patterns; Resnick prediction formula,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The utilization of high-fidelity human simulation in nursing provides nursing faculty and students the opportunity to expand the boundaries of conventional learning from an instructional paradigm to a blending of modalities that enrich the student experience and provide an avenue for self-determined learning. The inception of computer-generated high-fidelity human simulation technology into the undergraduate nursing curriculum generated this correlation study, which examined two separate groups of senior baccalaureate nursing students’ reported self-efficacy for providing family-centered care. This research examined each group of students’ reported self-efficacy on the first day of the pediatric semester before and after simulation and on the last day of the pediatric semester before and after simulation. In addition, the relationship between two senior baccalaureate nursing student groups’ reported self-efficacy at four data points was examined. The concluding data identified that senior baccalaureate nursing students have unrealistic self-assessments of their clinical knowledge and nursing performance capabilities before simulation scenario participation. The perceived ability of undergraduate students to self-identify their previously acquired knowledge and transferable clinical reasoning to family-centered situations is inaccurate.

In Study 1, results from 530 teachers in Israel confirmed the predicted 5-factor model comprising relational goals, whereby teachers aspire to create close and caring relationships with students, in addition to the previously identified mastery, ability-approach, ability-avoidance, and work avoidance goals for teaching. Results from a subsample of 272 teachers confirmed that the teachers' goals were coherently and differentially related to their teaching practices, assessed several months later. The most important results showed that only relational goals predicted teacher social support; they also predicted mastery instruction. Teacher ability-approach and ability-avoidance goals both predicted performance instructional practices. Multilevel analyses of data from 73 teacher–class pairs (1,790 students) in Study 2 showed that teacher relational goals also predicted student reports of teacher social support and mastery instruction; mastery goals were negatively associated with student perceptions of performance practices. Teachers' goals, but not teachers' reports of instruction, predicted students' perceptions of instruction. The results supported extension of Butler's model to incorporate relational goals for teaching and confirmed that strivings to connect are at the heart of effective teaching. The results also shed new light on relations between teachers' goals and teachers' approaches to instruction and on teacher and student perspectives on instruction. Differences in boys' and girls' perceptions of instruction imply that it is important to consider possible gender differences in research on classroom goal structures.

Please provide one or more examples of approaches you found to be effective."" We augmented this information with suggestions from a number of colleagues in other settings. In a series of iterations, we analyzed all their suggestions to identify key teaching methods. We found that barriers to teaching humanism largely consist of elements of the informal and hidden curricula in medical schools. We then defined methods to help teachers overcome these barriers. Specific methods fall into the 3 categories of taking advantage of seminal events, role modeling, and using active learning skills.

Most recent systematic reviews and meta-analysis of studies on Game-based learning and GbEl in the medical professions have shown limited effects of these instructional methods. Objectives To compare the effectiveness on the learning outcome of a Game-based e-learning (GbEl) instruction with a conventional script-based instruction in the teaching of phase contrast microscopy urinalysis under routine training conditions of undergraduate medical students. Methods A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 145 medical students in their third year of training in the Department of Urology at the University Medical Center Freiburg, Germany. 82 subjects where allocated for training with an educational adventure-game (GbEl group) and 69 subjects for conventional training with a written script-based approach (script group). Learning outcome was measured with a 34 item single choice test. Students' attitudes were collected by a questionnaire regarding fun with the training, motivation to continue the training and self-assessment of acquired knowledge. Results The students in the GbEl group achieved significantly better results in the cognitive knowledge test than the students in the script group: the mean score was 28.6 for the GbEl group and 26.0 for the script group of a total of 34.0 points with a Cohen's d effect size of 0.71 (ITT analysis). Attitudes towards the recent learning experience were significantly more positive with GbEl. Students reported to have more fun while learning with the game when compared to the script-based approach. Conclusions Game-based e-learning is more effective than a script-based approach for the training of urinalysis in regard to cognitive learning outcome and has a high positive motivational impact on learning. Game-based e-learning can be used as an effective teaching method for self-instruction.",12/5/2013,7/2/2022 18:17,7/2/2022 18:17,5/20/2022 0:10,e82328,,12,8,,PLOS ONE,Game-Based E-Learning Is More Effective than a Conventional Instructional Method,,,,,,,en,,,,,PLoS Journals,,Publisher: Public Library of Science,,/Users/nicolapoppy/Zotero/storage/5WMFDCLY/Boeker et al_2013_Game-Based E-Learning Is More Effective than a Conventional Instructional Method.pdf; /Users/nicolapoppy/Zotero/storage/9FMKGSZ2/article.html,,,Randomized controlled trials; Medical education; Games; Human learning; Phase contrast microscopy; Psychological attitudes; Urine; Urology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BTVLL4AH,journalArticle,2016,"Bowers, Jeffrey S.",The practical and principled problems with educational neuroscience,Psychological Review,,1939-1471,10.1037/rev0000025,,"The core claim of educational neuroscience is that neuroscience can improve teaching in the classroom. Many strong claims are made about the successes and the promise of this new discipline. By contrast, I show that there are no current examples of neuroscience motivating new and effective teaching methods, and argue that neuroscience is unlikely to improve teaching in the future. The reasons are twofold. First, in practice, it is easier to characterize the cognitive capacities of children on the basis of behavioral measures than on the basis of brain measures. As a consequence, neuroscience rarely offers insights into instruction above and beyond psychology. Second, in principle, the theoretical motivations underpinning educational neuroscience are misguided, and this makes it difficult to design or assess new teaching methods on the basis of neuroscience. Regarding the design of instruction, it is widely assumed that remedial instruction should target the underlying deficits associated with learning disorders, and neuroscience is used to characterize the deficit. However, the most effective forms of instruction may often rely on developing compensatory (nonimpaired) skills. Neuroscience cannot determine whether instruction should target impaired or nonimpaired skills. More importantly, regarding the assessment of instruction, the only relevant issue is whether the child learns, as reflected in behavior. Evidence that the brain changed in response to instruction is irrelevant. At the same time, an important goal for neuroscience is to characterize how the brain changes in response to learning, and this includes learning in the classroom. Neuroscientists cannot help educators, but educators can help neuroscientists.

Our sample included 1,700 students placed in the classrooms of 12 middle school and 12 high school science teachers. The instruction for both groups included a week long, laboratory-based, forensics unit. Students were given pre-, post-, and delayed posttests, the results of which were analyzed through a Hierarchical Linear Model (HLM) using students' scores, teacher, level of school, Reformed Teaching Observation Protocol (RTOP) scores, and school socioeconomic status. Overall, compared to students in traditional sections, students who participated in an inquiry-based laboratory unit showed significantly higher posttest scores; had the higher scores, more growth, and long-term retention at both the high school and middle school levels, if their teacher had stronger implementation of inquiry methods (as measured by RTOP scores); and tended to have better outcomes than those who learned through traditional methods, regardless of level of poverty in the school.

We compare the two units for their effectiveness in supporting students’ complex systems thinking and computational thinking skills. We find that while both units improved student outcomes to roughly the same extent, they engendered different perspectives on the content. That is, students using the physical system were more likely to interpret situations from a bottom-up (“agent”) perspective, and students using the virtual system were more likely to employ a top-down (“aggregate”) perspective. Our outcomes suggest that the medium of students’ interactions with systems leads to differences in their learning from and about those systems.

These surveys mirror business practices where measuring customer satisfaction via surveys is common. However, some argue that universities are misdirected in measuring satisfaction as a proxy for teaching quality, possibly subverting the potentially conflicting objective of student learning. Even so, both student satisfaction and student learning can be relevant performance measures. Accordingly, we have developed two robust measures of these constructs.

Near-peer teaching is widely regarded as an effective teaching modality; however, whether near-peer teaching experiences in medical school prepare students for the teaching demands of residency is less understood. We explored whether the anatomy-based SAT program through the Human Structure didactic block at Mayo Medical School addressed the core teaching competencies of a medical educator and prepared its participants for further teaching roles in their medical careers. A web-based survey was sent to all teaching assistants in the anatomy-based SAT program over the past five years (2007–2011). Survey questions were constructed based on previously published competencies in seven teaching domains – course development, course organization, teaching execution, student coaching, student assessment, teacher evaluation, and scholarship.

However, the realization of these goals continues to elude the science education community partly because of a persistent, albeit not empirically supported, coupling of the two goals in the form of ‘teaching about NOS with inquiry’. In this context, the present paper aims, first, to introduce the notions of, and articulate the distinction between, teaching with and about NOS, which will allow for the meaningful coupling of the two desired goals. Second, the paper aims to explicate science teachers’ knowledge domains requisite for effective teaching with and about NOS. The paper argues that research and development efforts dedicated to helping science teachers develop deep, robust, and integrated NOS understandings would have the dual benefits of not only enabling teachers to convey to students images of science and scientific practice that are commensurate with historical, philosophical, sociological, and psychological scholarship (teaching about NOS), but also to structure robust inquiry learning environments that approximate authentic scientific practice, and implement effective pedagogical approaches that share a lot of the characteristics of best science teaching practices (teaching with NOS).",9/1/2013,7/2/2022 18:17,7/2/2022 18:17,5/20/2022 0:32,2087-2107,,9,22,,Sci & Educ,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Springer Link,,,,"/Users/nicolapoppy/Zotero/storage/CZAKE4QA/Abd-El-Khalick_2013_Teaching With and About Nature of Science, and Science Teacher Knowledge Domains.pdf",,,Knowledge Domain; Pedagogical Content Knowledge; Science Content; Science Content Knowledge; Science Teacher,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To identify the competencies required of an effective teacher in medical education, the authors developed a comprehensive conceptual model.         After conducting a literature search, the authors met at a two-day conference (2006) with 16 medical and nonmedical educators from 10 different U.S. and Canadian organizations and developed an initial draft of the “Teaching as a Competency” conceptual model. Conference participants used the physician competencies (from the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education [ACGME]) and the roles (from the Royal College's Canadian Medical Education Directives for Specialists [CanMEDS]) to define critical skills for medical educators. The authors then refined this initial framework through national/regional conference presentations (2007, 2008), an additional literature review, and expert input. Four core values grounded this framework: learner engagement, learner-centeredness, adaptability, and self-reflection.         The authors identified six core competencies, based on the ACGME competencies framework: medical (or content) knowledge; learner- centeredness; interpersonal and communication skills; professionalism and role modeling; practice-based reflection; and systems-based practice. They also included four specialized competencies for educators with additional programmatic roles: program design/implementation, evaluation/scholarship, leadership, and mentorship. The authors then cross-referenced the competencies with educator roles, drawing from CanMEDS, to recognize role-specific skills.

In this paper, we ask what the existing evidence implies for how school leaders might recruit, evaluate, and retain teachers. We begin by summarizing the evidence on five key points, referring to existing work and to evidence we have accumulated from our research with the nation's two largest school districts: Los Angeles and New York City. First, teachers display considerable heterogeneity in their effects on student achievement gains. Second, estimates of teacher effectiveness based on student achievement data are noisy measures. Third, teachers' effectiveness rises rapidly in the first year or two of their teaching careers but then quickly levels out. Fourth, the primary cost of teacher turnover is not the direct cost of hiring and firing, but rather is the loss to students who will be taught by a novice teacher rather than one with several years of experience. Fifth, it is difficult to identify at the time of hire those teachers who will prove more effective. As a result, better teachers can only be identified after some evidence on their actual job performance has accumulated. We then explore what these facts imply for how principals and school districts should act, using a simple model in which schools must search for teachers using noisy signals of teacher effectiveness. The implications of our analysis are strikingly different from current practice. Rather than screening at the time of hire, the evidence on heterogeneity of teacher performance suggests a better strategy would be identifying large differences between teachers by observing the first few years of teaching performance and retaining only the highest-performing teachers.",8/1/2010,7/2/2022 18:19,7/2/2022 18:19,6/14/2022 2:05,97-118,,3,24,,Journal of Economic Perspectives,,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,/Users/nicolapoppy/Zotero/storage/XZU3IZG3/Staiger_Rockoff_2010_Searching for Effective Teachers with Imperfect Information.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The classroom-based German preventive intervention “Medienhelden” (engl.: “Media Heroes”) builds on previous knowledge about links between cognitive empathy, affective empathy, and cyberbullying, among others. For an evaluation study, longitudinal data were available from 722 high school students aged 11–17 years (M = 13.36, SD = 1.00, 51.8% female) before and six months after the implementation of the program. A 10-week version and a 1-day version were conducted and compared with a control group (controlled pre-long-term-follow-up study). Schools were asked to randomly assign their participating classes to the intervention conditions. Multi-group structural equation modeling (SEM) showed a significant effect of the short intervention on cognitive empathy and significant effects of the long intervention on affective empathy and cyberbullying reduction. The results suggest the long-term intervention to be more effective in reducing cyberbullying and promoting affective empathy. Without any intervention, cyberbullying increased and affective empathy decreased across the study period. Empathy change was not generally directly linked to change in cyberbullying behavior. “Media Heroes” provides effective teaching materials and empowers schools to address the important topic of cyberbullying in classroom settings without costly support from the outside.

It has been shown that teachers’ PCK correlates with teaching effectiveness as well as with students’ achievement gains. Teachers’ PCK should be analyzed as one of the main important components to evaluate professional development programs. On this account, it is necessary to develop standardized measures of biology teachers’ topic-specific PCK that are labor-efficient. This paper presents a study on the development, evaluation, and validation of a paper-and-pencil test to measure biology teachers’ declarative PCK on the topic of blood and the human cardiovascular system. The development of the test was based, among other considerations, on a review of research literature on PCK and an analysis of 50 videotaped biology lessons. The final test instrument was comprised of 15 items distributed across 2 scales. The findings of the main study—with 93 preservice and in-service biology teachers and 12 biologists—confirmed that this measure of biology teachers’ declarative PCK was reliable, objective, and valid. In-service biology teachers scored higher on the test than preservice teachers (effect size Cohen’s d, 0.65) on one hand and, also, than biologists (Cohen’s d, 1.00) on the other hand. Future versions of this test should explore enlarging the scales and measuring procedural aspects of PCK.",12/1/2013,7/2/2022 18:19,7/2/2022 18:19,5/19/2022 23:15,1369-1390,,6,11,,Int J of Sci and Math Educ,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Springer Link,,,,"/Users/nicolapoppy/Zotero/storage/V2VLJ9XR/Schmelzing et al_2013_DEVELOPMENT, EVALUATION, AND VALIDATION OF A PAPER-AND-PENCIL TEST FOR.pdf",,,teacher knowledge; pedagogical content knowledge; teacher assessment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the efforts to conceptualize these knowledge domains comes the question to what extent they can be distinguished empirically. Hence, the present study examines a measure that assesses pre-service teachers' self-efficacy in the technology-related TPACK dimensions (“T-dimensions”). In pursuit of crafting a validity argument, we investigated its factor structure and tested it for measurement invariance across gender and educational tracks, two subgroups that may indicate considerable differences. By means of multi-group confirmatory factor analysis, the data of N = 665 pre-service teachers in 18 teacher training institutions in Flanders (Belgium) revealed a nested factor structure of the TPACK measure, which comprised a general factor and a specific factor of pre-service teachers’ technological knowledge. This factor structure was fully invariant across gender and educational tracks. Mean differences between educational tracks did not occur; yet, substantial differences were found across gender in favor of male pre-service teachers.

The results show that the average effectiveness of teachers in high poverty schools is in general less than teachers in other schools and there is significantly greater variation in teacher quality among high poverty schools. These differences are largely driven by less productive teachers at the bottom of the teacher effectiveness distribution in high-poverty schools. The bulk of the quality differential is due to differences in the unmeasured characteristics of teachers. We find that the gain in productivity to more experienced teachers from additional experience is much stronger in lower-poverty schools. The lower return to experience in high-poverty schools does not appear to be a result of differences in the quality of teachers who leave teaching or who switch schools, however.

A total of 545 responses were received, which represents an 82.6% overall response rate. Responses were obtained from all accredited medical schools, and the sample was about equally divided between preclinical and clinical course directors. Less than 2 hours of total teaching time is allocated to sleep and sleep disorders, on average, with 37 schools reporting no structured teaching time whatever in this area.

Educators can leverage the strengths of medical simulators to effectively teach complex and high-risk surgical procedures, such as placement of an external ventricular drain. Objective Our objective was to develop a cost-effective, patient-derived medical simulacrum for cerebral lateral ventriculostomy. Methods A cost-effective, patient-derived medical simulacrum was developed for placement of an external lateral ventriculostomy. Elastomeric and gel casting techniques were used to achieve realistic brain geometry and material properties. 3D printing technology was leveraged to develop accurate cranial properties and dimensions. An economical, gravity-driven pump was developed to provide normal and abnormal ventricular pressures. A small pilot study was performed to gauge simulation efficacy using a technology acceptance model. Results An accurate geometric representation of the brain was developed with independent lateral cerebral ventricular chambers. A gravity-driven pump pressurized the ventricular cavities to physiologic values. A qualitative study illustrated that the simulation has potential as an educational tool to train medical professionals in the ventriculostomy procedure.

The first meta-analysis, including 22 of the 27 studies, involved a comparison of the effects of transformational and instructional leadership on student outcomes. The second meta-analysis involved a comparison of the effects of five inductively derived sets of leadership practices on student outcomes. Twelve of the studies contributed to this second analysis., Findings: The first meta-analysis indicated that the average effect of instructional leadership on student outcomes was three to four times that of transformational leadership. Inspection of the survey items used to measure school leadership revealed five sets of leadership practices or dimensions: establishing goals and expectations; resourcing strategically; planning, coordinating, and evaluating teaching and the curriculum; promoting and participating in teacher learning and development, and ensuring an orderly and supportive environment. The second meta-analysis revealed strong average effects for the leadership dimension involving promoting and participating in teacher learning and development and moderate effects for the dimensions concerned with goal setting and planning, coordinating, and evaluating teaching and the curriculum., Conclusions and Implications for Research and Practice:The comparisons between transformational and instructional leadership and between the five leadership dimensions suggested that the more leaders focus their relationships, their work, and their learning on the core business of teaching and learning, the greater their influence on student outcomes.

Medical education at all levels should be designed to equip physicians with the knowledge, clinical skills, and professionalism that are required to deliver quality patient care. The ultimate outcome is the health of the patient and the health status of the society. In the translational science of medical education, improved patient outcomes linked directly to educational events are the ultimate goal and are best defined by rigorous medical education research efforts. To best develop faculty, the same principles of adult education and teaching adults apply. In a systematic review of faculty development initiatives designed to improve teaching effectiveness in medical education, the use of experiential learning, feedback, effective relationships with peers, and diverse educational methods were found to be most important in the success of these programs. In this article, we present 5 examples of applying the best practices in teaching adults and utilizing the emerging understanding of the neurobiology of learning in teaching students, trainees, and practitioners. These include (1) use of standardized patients to develop communication skills, (2) use of online quizzes to assess knowledge and aid self-directed learning, (3) use of practice sessions and video clips to enhance significant learning of teaching skills, (4) use of case-based discussions to develop professionalism concepts and skills, and (5) use of the American Academy of Pediatrics PediaLink as a model for individualized learner-directed online learning. These examples highlight how experiential leaning, providing valuable feedback, opportunities for practice, and stimulation of self-directed learning can be utilized as medical education continues its dynamic transformation in the years ahead.",7/1/2014,7/2/2022 18:17,7/2/2022 18:17,5/19/2022 16:17,170-181,,6,44,,Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care,,Adult Education: New Concepts and Effective Methods for Today’s Learners,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,/Users/nicolapoppy/Zotero/storage/X3NN7X8T/Reed et al_2014_Applying Adult Learning Practices in Medical Education.pdf; /Users/nicolapoppy/Zotero/storage/WAF2DMT3/S1538544214000182.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Twelve roles have previously been described for medical teachers, grouped into six major tasks: (1) the information provider; (2) the role model; (3) the facilitator; (4) the assessor; (5) the curriculum and course planner; and (6) the resource material creator (Harden & Crosby 2000).It is clear that many of these roles require a teacher to be more than a medical expert. In a pure educational setting, teachers may have limited roles, but the clinical teacher often plays many roles simultaneously, switching from one role to another during the same encounter. The large majority of clinical teachers around the world have received rigorous training in medical knowledge and skills but little to none in teaching. As physicians become ever busier in their own clinical practice, being effective teachers becomes more challenging in the context of expanding clinical responsibilities and shrinking time for teaching (Prideaux et al. ). Clinicians on the frontline are often unaware of educational mandates from licensing and accreditation bodies as well as medical schools and postgraduate training programmes and this has major implications for staff training. Institutions need to provide necessary orientation and training for their clinical teachers. This Guide looks at the many challenges for teachers in the clinical environment, application of relevant educational theories to the clinical context and practical teaching tips for clinical teachers.

Other research shows that atmospheres of trust, shared vision, and openness create positive school climate conditions. Little is known, however, about how these climates emerge in some schools and not others. There is good theoretical reason to suspect that interpersonal relationships between principals and their teachers influence school professionals’ attitudes that define the broader school climate. Theories from organizational studies, social psychology, and sociology inform hypotheses about how affective, cathectic responses from interpersonal principal–teacher relationships explain variation in school professionals’ satisfaction, cohesion, and commitment levels. Research Design: Nationally representative data from the Schools and Staffing Survey, 2003–04, match principals to teachers in public elementary schools. Using structural equation modeling, relational mechanisms between principals and their teachers are identified and explain positive principal attitudes. This process is then linearly regressed to explain the effects of these relationships on teachers’ attitudes. Findings: Principals’ relationships with their teachers affect principals’ and teachers’ satisfaction, cohesion, and commitment levels. Among principals, these positive work relationships improve job satisfaction, cohesion perceptions, and commitment levels. Among teachers, substantial variation is explained directly by the relationship mechanism of principals sharing expectations with their teachers. Conclusions: School professionals’ attitudes form under similar organizational conditions as those of other workers. These relationships affect the schooling environment. Because of their centrality and leadership position, particular focus is paid to role of the principal in these relationships. The relationships of principals, as the school leader, strongly and directly affect teachers’ attitudes, which define the schooling climate.",2/1/2012,7/2/2022 18:17,7/2/2022 18:17,5/19/2022 21:36,39-85,,1,48,,Educational Administration Quarterly,Principal–Teacher Interactions,,,,,,,en,,,,,SAGE Journals,,Publisher: SAGE Publications Inc,,/Users/nicolapoppy/Zotero/storage/I9JI3TJ5/Price_2012_Principal–Teacher Interactions.pdf,,,school effectiveness; teacher effectiveness; principals; school climate; school organization,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, academic institutions and faculty are increasingly using social networking sites, such as Facebook and LinkedIn, to connect with current and potential students and to deliver instructional content. This has led to a rise in questions about the impact of OSN on academic performance and the possibility of using it as an effective teaching tool. To learn more about the impact on academic performance, we conducted a survey of business students at a large state university. Survey results were analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM). The results revealed a statistically significant negative relationship between time spent by students on OSN and their academic performance. The time spent on OSN was found to be heavily influenced by the attention span of the students. Specifically, we determined that the higher the attention span, the lower is the time spent on OSN. Further, attention span was found to be highly correlated with characteristics that predict or influence student behavior, such as their perceptions about society’s view of social networking, their likes and dislikes of OSN, ease of use of OSN, etc.",11/1/2012,7/2/2022 18:17,7/2/2022 18:17,5/19/2022 16:07,2117-2127,,6,28,,Computers in Human Behavior,,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,/Users/nicolapoppy/Zotero/storage/EMKHTM5N/Paul et al_2012_Effect of online social networking on student academic performance.pdf; /Users/nicolapoppy/Zotero/storage/468UGYML/S0747563212001665.html,,,Facebook; Twitter; Structural equation modeling; Online social networking; Theory of planned behavior,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Respondents indicated some advances since a similar survey in 1977: Virtually all medical schools now offer teaching in medical interviewing and interpersonal skills. More faculty from a greater variety of disciplines are involved in this teaching. Most programs feature observation and feedback of students' interviews with patients, and use a variety of effective teaching methods, including simulated patients and role-playing, both little used in 1977. The majority of schools address students' personal growth through discussion or support groups. However, there are problems. Most schools lack a faculty development process. About half of the introductory courses on medical interviewing take place within physical diagnosis courses, often, it appears, without systematic observation, feedback, and evaluation of student skills. Many programs do not explicitly incorporate certain educational principles into their course designs. As in 1977, there appears to be little coordination or sequencing of teaching interpersonal skills throughout the curriculum in most medical schools.

Factors taken into account in the holistic model of teacher evaluation used in the project included individual differences among students, instructor style, instructor-student interaction, environmental factors, and organizational factors. To investigate student differences, surveys were distributed to students on the first day of classes each quarter, soliciting information on their educational backgrounds, goals, motivations, expectations, characteristics, world views, personality  characteristics, and styles of creativity. The instructor also completed personality and world view inventories to gather information on instructor style and was observed and videotaped to examine in-class dynamics, exchanges, feedback to students, and the social-psychological climate. In addition, students were surveyed about the course and interviewed to determine their perspective of teaching and learning in the course. These students showed that they were very perceptive about the instructor's goals, had constructive suggestions for improvement, and enjoyed being asked about their ideas.

Thus, in PE, it is important to assess the teaching and learning processes related to expected outcomes, including what students and teachers do and how lessons are delivered. Within a public health context, it is then important to assess how teachers provide students with ample health-enhancing physical activity to help them become physically fit and to learn generalizable movement and behavioral skills designed to promote physical activity and fitness outside of class time.

The home based component involves parents of children with autism as key participants in their children's learning and prepares them to be effective advocates in their children's futures. The curriculum addresses what it is that toddlers need to learn, what environmental arrangements provide the most powerful teaching opportunities, and how teachers and parents can most effectively teach children to progress at their optimum pace.

The first is a usage gap. Compared to how and how much today's students use technology outside school, in-school technology usage is much less intensive and extensive. The second is an outcome gap. Compared with the outcomes achieved through investment in technology in sectors outside education, the gains in terms reduced costs and increased productivity achieved by schools is significantly smaller. This article discusses the causes of these two gaps and provides suggestions for bridging them by engaging in discussions about effective teaching and committing to technology planning.",2013,7/2/2022 18:17,7/2/2022 18:17,5/19/2022 23:05,59-68,,2,16,,,Bridging the Gap,,,,,,,,,,,,JSTOR,,Publisher: International Forum of Educational Technology & Society,,/Users/nicolapoppy/Zotero/storage/XHBRGIN4/Lim et al. - 2013 - Bridging the Gap Technology Trends and Use of Tec.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using 2 observation instruments, the Infant/Toddler Environment Rating Scale–Revised (ITERS-R) and the Classroom Assessment Scoring System, Toddler Version (CLASS-Toddler), 93 child care classrooms for toddlers across the state of North Carolina, representing a range of quality, were assessed to determine overall quality, and associations between observed quality and teachers' ratings of child behavior problems and competence outcomes using the Brief Infant Toddler Social Emotional Assessment. Research Findings: Findings indicated that overall, toddler classrooms were rated as being of moderate quality. Associations between observed quality and teacher-reported child behavior problems and competence outcomes indicated that CLASS-Toddler ratings were positively associated with fewer behavior problems; specifically, children in classrooms with higher levels on the CLASS-Toddler domains of Emotional and Behavioral Support as well as Engaged Support for Learning were reported to have fewer behavior problems. Similarly, the ITERS-R subscales of Interaction and Listening and Talking were positively related to fewer reported behavior problems. Regression models showed that the CLASS-Toddler Emotional and Behavioral Support domain predicted differences in child behavior problems. Practice or Policy: Findings suggest the need for additional research related to very young children's experiences in center-based child care to examine associations between quality and child experiences and outcomes.

Methods: A prospective, randomized study of second-, third-, and fourth-year EM residents was performed. Of 36 potential subjects, 27 residents were enrolled. Each resident was assessed at baseline and after the intervention using 1) a questionnaire to evaluate confidence in leading adult, pediatric, and neonatal resuscitation and prior neonatal resuscitation experience and 2) a neonatal resuscitation simulation scenario in which each participant was the code leader to evaluate knowledge and skills. Assessments were digitally recorded and reviewed independently by two Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) instructors using a validated neonatal resuscitation scoring tool. Controls (15 participants) received the current EM curriculum. The intervention group (12 participants) experienced an educational session, which incorporated didactics, skills station, and medical simulation about neonatal resuscitation. Outcomes measured included changes in overall neonatal resuscitation score, number of critical actions, time to initial steps of neonatal resuscitation, and changes in confidence level leading neonatal resuscitation. Results: Baseline neonatal resuscitation scores were similar for the control and intervention groups. At the final assessment, the intervention group’s neonatal resuscitation score improved (p = 0.016) and the control group’s score did not. The intervention group performed 2.31 more critical actions overall and the time to achieve warming (p = 0.0002), drying (p < 0.0001), tactile stimulation (p = 0.002), and placing a hat on the patient (p <0.0001) were also improved compared to controls. At the baseline assessment, 80% of the control group and 75% of the intervention group reported being “not at all confident” in leading neonatal resuscitation. At the final assessment, the proportion of residents who were “not at all confident” leading neonatal resuscitation decreased to 35% in the intervention group compared to 67% of the control group. The majority of the intervention group (65%) reported an increased level of confidence in leading neonatal resuscitation. Conclusions: Medical simulation can be an effective tool to assess the knowledge and skills of EM residents in neonatal resuscitation.

Three-dimensional visualization (3DV) is a useful tool in anatomy teaching, but current models do not capture haptic qualities. However, three-dimensional printing (3DP) can produce highly accurate complex physical models. Therefore, in this study we aimed to develop a novel 3DP hepatic segment model and compare the teaching effectiveness of a 3DV model, a 3DP model, and a traditional anatomical atlas. Materials and Methods A healthy candidate (female, 50-years old) was recruited and scanned with computed tomography. After three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction, the computed 3D images of the hepatic structures were obtained. The parenchyma model was divided into 8 hepatic segments to produce the 3DV hepatic segment model. The computed 3DP model was designed by removing the surrounding parenchyma and leaving the segmental partitions. Then, 6 experts evaluated the 3DV and 3DP models using a 5-point Likert scale. A randomized controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the educational effectiveness of these models compared with that of the traditional anatomical atlas. Results The 3DP model successfully displayed the hepatic segment structures with partitions. All experts agreed or strongly agreed that the 3D models provided good realism for anatomical instruction, with no significant differences between the 3DV and 3DP models in each index (p > 0.05). Additionally, the teaching effects show that the 3DV and 3DP models were significantly better than traditional anatomical atlas in the first and second examinations (p < 0.05).

The current research examined the relationship between the Big Five personality traits and individual differences in college students’ academic motivation. Individuals (172 undergraduates) were asked to complete the NEO Five Factor Inventory (Costa & McCrae, 1992) and the Academic Motivations Inventory (AMI; Moen & Doyle, 1977). Results revealed a complex pattern of significant relationships between the Big Five traits and the 16 subscales of the AMI. Stepwise (forward) multiple regressions further clarified the relationships between personality and three core factors of the AMI (engagement, achievement, and avoidance). Specifically, engagement was best explained by Openness to experience and Extraversion. Achievement was best explained by Conscientiousness, Neuroticism, and Openness to experience. Finally, avoidance was best explained by Neuroticism, Extraversion, and by an inverse relationship with Conscientiousness and Openness to experience. Results are interpreted in terms of creating an appropriate fit between teaching modalities and individual differences in students’ academic motivation due to personality traits. Directions for future research and educational practice are considered.",8/1/2005,7/2/2022 18:17,7/2/2022 18:17,6/14/2022 1:05,557-567,,3,39,,Personality and Individual Differences,,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,/Users/nicolapoppy/Zotero/storage/QFN8T2PX/Komarraju and Karau - 2005 - The relationship between the big five personality .pdf; /Users/nicolapoppy/Zotero/storage/9VH2WKJJ/S0191886905000632.html,,,Academic motivation; Big five; Personality traits,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to characterise the alternative approaches toteaching of university lecturers, and to examine the relationshipbetween lecturers' approaches to teaching and their conceptions of goodteaching. This study adopted an open naturalistic approach. Seventeenlecturers in three departments in a university were selected forinterview based on their rank, years of teaching and industrial orprofessional experience. Lecturers were interviewed individually abouttheir conceptions of good teaching, motivational strategies andeffective teaching. The interview records were then content analysed bythe two researchers of the study. The study found that (a) it waspossible to characterise lecturers' approaches to teaching with onemotivation and five strategy dimensions; (b) the conceptions of teachingof the lecturers were best described by two main orientations oftransmissive and facilitative teaching; (c) lecturers who conceivedteaching as transmitting knowledge were more likely to usecontent-centred approaches to teaching, while those who conceivedteaching as facilitative tended to use learning-centred approaches.

Alternative forms of assessment such as e-portfolios have gained recognition in documenting students’ learning, as it is synchronous with both product and process. Vast amount of literature narrates the relative advantages of e-portfolios across disciplines, institutions, and applications. In Malaysia, such alternative assessment practices are less explored so far in teacher education. In this study, 55 pre-service TESOL teachers from Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) are required to create and maintain a personal e-portfolio. The aim of the study is to ascertain the future teachers’ practices with e-portfolios in their learning and to determine if these practices lead to teaching competencies. In addition, the study also aims to identify the benefits and challenges of using an e-portfolio as a tool for learning and self-assessment. Findings indicate that participants are appreciative of e-portfolios, as their performance and achievements are traced over time. It is also found that e-portfolios function as a monitoring tool, which helps the teachers recognize their learning and identify their strengths and weaknesses. Challenges are also noted, which include validity and reliability, interrupted Internet connection, negative attitudes participants, time constraints, workload and ethical issues. In terms of teacher competencies, it is found that six competencies emerge from the teachers’ practices of e-portfolios – (1) developing understanding of an effective teacher’s role; (2) developing teaching approaches/activities; (3) improving linguistic abilities; (4) comprehending content knowledge; (5) gaining ICT skills and; (6) the realization of the need to change mindsets.",5/1/2012,7/2/2022 18:17,7/2/2022 18:17,5/19/2022 16:04,1007-1020,,4,58,,Computers & Education,Assessing pre-service English language teachers’ learning using e-portfolios,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,/Users/nicolapoppy/Zotero/storage/2FCRS8W4/1-s2.0-S0360131511002922-main.pdf; /Users/nicolapoppy/Zotero/storage/2BRXA94E/S0360131511002922.html,,,Computer-mediated communication; Evaluation methodologies; Interactive learning environments; Learning communities; Post-secondary education,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
